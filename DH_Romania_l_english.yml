dhromania.0.t:0 "End of the Regency"
dhromania.0.d:0 ""I reject republicanism. At the head of races, above the elite, there is Monarchy. Not all monarchs have been good. Monarchy, however, has always been good. The individual monarch must not be confused with the institution of Monarchy, the conclusions drawn from this would be false. There can be bad priests, but this does not mean that we can draw the conclusion that the Church must be ended and God stoned to death. There are certainly weak or bad monarchs, but we cannot renounce Monarchy." With these dogmatic words, Corneliu Codreanu has stepped down as regent of Romania, allowing the young king, Michael I, to assume his throne. This event has astounded some, who mistakenly viewed the Iron Guard as dedicated only to furthering the Conducator's message throughout the Balkans. While some believe Romania has returned to its status quo, very little has actually changed. Codreanu and the Iron Guard still retain full control over the Romanian government, all that has changed is the official head of state. Romania's current political landscape still remains heated, and only time will tell whether Michael's ascension will quell the flames of conflict, or strengthen them."
dhromania.0.a:0 "Long Live King Michael I!"
