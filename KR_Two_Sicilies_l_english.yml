SIC_DH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was born out of the Napoleonic wars and lasted until 1860 when Sardinia unified Italy under her rule. The South suffered at the hands of the House of Savoy and poverty became commonplace. When the Weltkrieg began in 1914 Italy chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. The Austrians achieved victory against the Italians, broke up Italy, and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was born again. The politically successful Social Democrats have tried to carve out a new path for the Kingdom. But the rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Ddoje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics. Only time will tell."

SIC_theshipyardmatter_desc:0 "Sicily has, for more than a decade, greatly profited from the use of its large drydocks to sell warships to various nations in these troubled times.

SIC_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
SIC_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality.

SIC_hit_papacy:0 "The Vatican is Vulnerable"
SIC_hit_papacy_desc:0 "Even with socialists to the North and their cause discredited the Papal States continues to play their power games, proving they will always aid themselves to the cost of true leadership.

SIC_ghibelline_revival:0 "Ghibelline Revival"
SIC_ghibelline_revival_desc:0 "Against the mercantilist Guelphs the Ghibelline understood that spiritual power should rest with the Emperor alone.

SIC_constrained_science:0 "Science Constrained"

### Events ###

sic.1.t:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in 1936"
sic.1.d:0 "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, lasting until 1860 when Sardinia sought to unite Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoies who did not care much for actually industrialising the south and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began in 1914 Italy chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. When the Austrians achieved victory against the Italians, they broke up the Kingdom into a number of smaller states, and out of the resulting bloody civil war the Kingdom of The Two Sicilies was reborn.\n\nSince the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been focused internally, trying to resolve the serious issues left by the House of Savoy, and the politically successful Social Democrats have tried to carve out a new path for the Kingdom. The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Ddoje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics.\n\nOnly time will tell if they get to achieve this or if democracy will prevail."
sic.1.a:0 "Long live the King!"

sic.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits the Kingdom"
sic.2.d:0 "The economic crisis that began in Germany has spiralled out of control and spread to Italy. The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies' prosperity has been shattered by Black Monday and confidence in the government has been shaken."
sic.2.a:0 "May God protect us!"

sic.3.t:0 "Poverty and Crime Rises"
sic.3.d:0 "With Black Monday hitting our kingdom hard, it has caused poverty to skyrocket and the living standards of many Sicilians to drop. At the same time, the various criminal cartels have moved in to take advantage of this situation, much to the detriment of the government. Banditry and brigandry have increased out in the countryside, and many are demanding that the government do something. However the power of local nobles and their opposition to Bourban power makes it difficut to take the most drastic steps needed to end this depression until their power is dealt with."
sic.3.a:0 "Something must be done!"

sic.4.t:0 "The Camicie Nere"
sic.4.d:0 "With the rise of crime in the country due to Black Monday, the Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale have been formed. The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo and everything in between. Supposedly lead by Achille Starace, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left wing. Joining Starace is the more controversial Julius Evola whom was only reluctantly allowed into the organization for his far-right monarchist views and the small but fanatical following he brings with him, especially amongst the sons of the upper-class. Nonetheless his past anti-Papal and anti-Bourban views marks him as divisive even within the Camicie Nere but the black-shirts desire a broad alliance... for now. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."
sic.4.a:0 "We should keep an eye on them."

sic.5.t:0 "A call for Traditional Values"
sic.5.d:0 "The conservative Archbishop of Naples, Alessio Ascalesi, has given a stern and powerful sermon calling for a return to traditional values and to turn away from Social Democratic policies that are ruining the kingdom and the fault for Black Monday. Many that support the Social Conservative Democrazia Cristiana have taken this as a sign, and are energised by his rhetoric."
sic.5.a:0 "May God protect the kingdom."

sic.6.t:0 "Fighting between the Left and Right"
sic.6.d:0 "A rally by the Confederazione Generale Siciliana del Lavoro or the 'Sicilian General Confederation of Labor' for the ruling Partito Cristiano Democratico was disrupted when members of the Camicie Nere disrupted their rally. This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."
sic.6.a:0 "The Union members are innocent."
sic.6.b:0 "They are disloyal traitors."

sic.7.t:0 "The Liberal Coalition"
sic.7.d:0 "Since the founding of the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, parliamentary power has been contested primarily by the Social Democrats and the Social Conservatives. However, with the rise of the Far Right and the creation of the Integralist Paramilitary force, the Partito Liberale and the Partito Popolare Democratico have agreed to form a coalition. This liberal pact is dedicated to preserving and strengthening liberal values within the Kingdom.\n\nThe creation of this alliance, however, weakens the Social Democratic party, for in the past the Partito Librale tended to support the Partito Cristiano Democratico.

The Legion recited a prayer inspired largely by the Mithraic mystery ritual while Evola burned the constitution. They they orderly exited the building and burned it down but not before supposedly drawing symbols inside for good luck.

While initially this was thought to mean arresting them most of the Knights are taking the opportunity to kill them on sight alongside whomever may be hiding them and confiscating their property. The most frequent of these victims are former labor union leaders and activists. This is not against their rules and indeed according to the Legion command it's an excellent chance for Two Sicilies to experience violent redemption but nonetheless some are saying that Evola should at least require political opponents to be brought in before being tried and executed in a more lawful fashion."

However more religiously fervent and morally disgusted members of the Integralist coalition, including Bernardo Attolico, Carmine Senise and Luigi Rizzo have refused to pledge loyalty and simply stated that they would continue to oppose "demonic demagoguery". Together they have chosen to continue the Camicie Nere as a separate organisation that continues to ignore our societies Spiritual Revolt.

The King has reassured the people he is merely opposing the presently pseudo-Christian Vatican for weakening the state while Evola has privately done the opposite with the Legion and declared the Holy War against darkness as truly beginning. With the Camicie Nere attacking Legion garrisons, stealing supplies and launching propaganda campaigns against us we must stop them.

Nonetheless from the supplies found it is both clear they were receiving foreign funding and, more importantly, have lost too much to recover as they have been chipped away at for too long to handle a blow of this size. While not all citizens have embraced us this may mark the end of our largest internal political resistance. Now while the Camice Nere soldiers are being publicly executed the question remains of what to do with their leaders, with some advocating a harsher death and others wanting to throw them in a deep hole and see if they break to give up more information."

Baron Evola would like to repurpose them as Legion posts where ceremonies can be held but other proposals are to hand it to the Nobility as a reward for loyalty or allow the serfs to take them over. However some Legionaries have rejected each of these proposals and have stated that they should be stripped clean of their riches by the state then burned to the ground to help end Papal influence in Two Siciles, an alternative Evola himself does not seem opposed to.

Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classical civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries. While the King is surprised by this turn of events he is also well aware this could keep the Nobles happy if he instituted it just for them and this would have less impact on society.

We could attempt to capture the city with the troops although we would likely lose many men in the process. Or, ironically, we could learn from the legacy of Cesare Borgia only with the Papacy on the receiving end this time and use artillery bombardment to force their surrender.

He then looked to the crowd and saw that nearly half of whom showed their thumbs to symbolize finishing the fallen foe with his sword, while the rest showed compressed fists that hid their thumb to symbolize sparing the man and sheathing the sword.

Some of our followers have even begun to raid taverns that are viewed as promoting hedonistic activities that posses no higher spiritual value. This line-of-thinking includes overthrowing the remaining banks, corporations and foreign owned properties that are viewed as disloyal or corrupt and putting them under the Kings domain and destroying utterly useless 'technologies' such as television.

The question now remains of how to treat those of mixed-race, Jewish and other minority ancestry with two proposals given. One is to allow them to organize into their own hierarchies modeled on our values for those whom pledge loyalty to the King, pay tribute, pledge soldiers to our wars and acknowledge the Kings and his Nobles supremacy. This way we can use the best of the aristocratic spirit that exists amongst themselves for our own purposes.

We have received a demand to give up our autonomy under threat of war by those bastardos Emmanuel and Evola! However with socialists to our north many advisors are claiming we do not stand a chance and that leaving them Rome is the lesser of two evils while we evacuate clerics from the area. However others are claiming that Evola is a pagan and that we should go down fighting. What shall we do?"

sic.160.t:0 "Papacy Caves In" 
sic.160.d:0 "Squeezed by enemies on all sides the Papacy decided it would be better to evacuate many of their bureaucrats and surrender the region to Victor Emmanuel III, a known longtime enemy of the church, rather than lose everything in a pointless war. However they still encouraged Catholics to resist the regime on the way out. Nonetheless it appears both Emmanuel and Evola have triumphed over their old for."

sic.161.d:0 "It appears as though the bond between King Emmanuel III and his High-Chancellor, Baron Julius Evola, has grown in recent months. The two hold many shared opinions on the King's powers and dignity, on culture and on the proper way of living ones life and both often unite in their hatred of the Catholic Church, liberals, socialists, politicians, progressives, democratic conservatives, Bourbons, anti-colonialists, republicans, "soft" men, insubordinate women and hedonists. Hunting trips, fishing and hiking are an increasingly common past-times for the two as they review stately material and has shifted the King into accepting even more right-wing positions than he hold before."

sic.163.d:0 "We have established fruitful relations with the Romanian Iron Guard, with a handful even being sent over to help us stabilize the situation. They have already agreed to our idea for a defensive alliance, something more of our advisors support as it will still allow us to be flexible in our foreign policy. Most legionaries would prefer an outright alliance led by Two-Siciles but our advisors are claiming we simply would not have the strength to fight all of our enemies between just the two of us and a defensive alliance is more practical."

sic.164.d:0 "While the Papacy evacuated the Pope and bureaucrats to stay weary of the King its attempts to dissolve all of its military and navy so that it would not fall into the hands of Evola were less than successful thanks to the intervention of Junio Valerio Borghese, AKA the Black Prince. An aristocrat and ultra-rightist, Borghese was a Papal admiral whom secretely harbored strong Evolian sympathies and founded a small cell of officers whom decided that if the Papacy evacuated they would stand by Rome and, therefor, the King of Savoy. The cell volunteered to stay behind to secure the evacuation and once they had left told the military and navy they were now in the services of Two Sicilies. A true Warrior and hero, the Black Prince shall be made an admiral of repute for his loyalty despite the Catholic Church's hatred of him, whom are now doing all they can to convince the populace this "treachery" was planned in conjunction with the House of Savoy."

It appears the Count heard about this and as a known champion fencer has requested the chance the duel the young man to the first blood or, failing that, the death. There is no question the Count would win and Evola has advised the King to allow it for the King's time is too important to micromanage every petty dispute of honor among the upper-class and that duels will encourage a culture of "truth, bravery and honor". More cautious on-lookers think the King should let his Court of Advisors simply settle these types of disputes themselves when the King does not have the time or desire to manage them."

sic.169.d:0 "In the capital of Calabria, Catanzaro, some of the serfs had yet to fully accept their place in the New Order and under the inspiration of an anti-Evolian poet named Filippo De Nobili decided revolt was their best chance, hoping it would inspire others to destroy our most Noble Beings. This failed of course but due to our reputation they decided to fight to the last man and women which made it especially costly to us, with the event already being called the Pillage of Catanzaro. More pressingly however the revolt only seemed to get out of hand because local soldiers decided to retreat instead of fighting them as ordered by their legionary commanders! We will need to set a precendent to make sure this does not happen again. The most popular proposal is to revive the Roman practice of decimatio, in which all of the disobedient soldiers will draw from a lottery and the ten percent who get the "losing straws" will be beaten to death by their comrades. Less popular proposals include leaving it in the hand of the commanders of themselves at the cost of the King's authority or wiping out every coward which, while tempting, would cost us much cannon fodder in our war against socialism. Of course this will also be setting a precedent for the future."
