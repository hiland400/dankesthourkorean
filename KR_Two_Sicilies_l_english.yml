###Bookmarks###
SIC_DH_GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "The Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was born out of the Napoleonic wars and lasted until 1860 when Sardinia unified Italy under her rule. The South suffered at the hands of the House of Savoy and poverty became commonplace. When the Weltkrieg began in 1914 Italy chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. The Austrians achieved victory against the Italians, broke up Italy, and the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was born again. The politically successful Social Democrats have tried to carve out a new path for the Kingdom. But the rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Ddoje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics. Only time will tell."

SIC_anti_clericalism:0 "Anti-Clericalism"
SIC_anti_clericalism_desc:0 "For too long the catholic priests have prevented the centralization of power under the monarch in favor of giving spiritual authority to a Papacy that preaches a modernist slave morality. While the transition out of traditional Catholicism will not be easy a good start would be anti-clericalism that cloaks the issue of the Pope's influence in just as nationalist terms than Spiritual ones."
SIC_hit_papacy:0 "The Vatican is Vulnerable"
SIC_hit_papacy_desc:0 "Even with socialists to the North and their cause discredited the Papal States continues to play their power games, proving they will always aid themselves to the cost of true leadership.

SIC_magical_societies:0 "Occult Societies"
SIC_magical_societies_desc:0 "Despite as predicted it having lower acceptance among the masses our newly established ruling class has come to embrace Evola's religious beliefs far more comfortably than the alternatives offered by Catholicism and atheism.

SIC_constrained_science:0 "Science Constrained"
SIC_constrained_science_desc:0 "It is no suprise that the vacuous modernist values sciences study of the material world over spiritual exploration.

But now they simply use their position to feed a lazy, limp-wristed aristocracy and their capitalist desires while holding off war with socialists for as long as possible.

sic.1.t:0 "1936년의 양시칠리아 왕국"
sic.1.d:0 "Following the Napoleonic wars, the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies was created, combining the two old kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, lasting until 1860 when Sardinia sought to unite Italy under her rule. The South, which was always generally agricultural, suffered at the hands of the Savoies who did not care much for actually industrialising the south and poverty became commonplace.\n\nWhen the Weltkrieg began in 1914 Italy chose the side of the Entente, much to her ruin. When the Austrians achieved victory against the Italians, they broke up the Kingdom into a number of smaller states, and out of the resulting bloody civil war the Kingdom of The Two Sicilies was reborn.\n\nSince the end of hostilities, the Kingdom has been focused internally, trying to resolve the serious issues left by the House of Savoy, and the politically successful Social Democrats have tried to carve out a new path for the Kingdom. The rise of the opposing 'Integralisti 'e Ddoje Sicilie' could signal a radical change in the Kingdom's politics.\n\nOnly time will tell if they get to achieve this or if democracy will prevail."

At the same time, the various criminal cartels have moved in to take advantage of this situation, much to the detriment of the government. Banditry and brigandry have increased out in the countryside, and many are demanding that the government do something. However the power of local nobles and their opposition to Bourban power makes it difficut to take the most drastic steps needed to end this depression until their power is dealt with."

The MVSN, or as they are informally called 'Camicie Nere' for their black shirts have been popping up throughout the kingdom, from Naples to Palermo and everything in between. Supposedly lead by Achille Starace, this paramilitary organisation is described as the muscle behind the Integralisti in the Kingdom for they have been keeping watch during their rallies, as well disrupting and breaking up rallies of the left wing. Joining Starace is the more controversial Julius Evola whom was only reluctantly allowed into the organization for his far-right monarchist views and the small but fanatical following he brings with him, especially amongst the sons of the upper-class. Nonetheless his past anti-Papal and anti-Bourban views marks him as divisive even within the Camicie Nere but the black-shirts desire a broad alliance... for now. Their disciplined, militaristic marches through the streets of major cities draw large crowds, and drum up more recruits, especially amongst the youth.\n\nThe Camicie Nere is rapidly becoming a force to be reckoned with, and their numbers are still expanding - it's unlikely they'll stay silent during the elections..."

This disruption quickly turned into a bloody battle that left quite a few injured, and even worse a few fatalities on both sides. While the CGSL has forsworn syndicalism, the Camicie Nere have been lately decrying their members as agents to the Socialist Republic in the North.\n\nNow the outcome of this particular case must be decided. Are these members innocent, or do the words of the Camicie Nere hold merit and truth? Many conservatives are siding with the Camicie Nere, declaring that they are traitors to the Kingdom, while some of the Liberals claim that they are innocent."

Much of the cause of these demands are from Evola's denunciation of monogomy for being what he views as a means for women to enslave male virility to "Eros", claiming not only that classical civilizations allowed the practice but that the domination of women was a natural way of expressing the male spirit. On a practical level it would also allow for a faster growing population of Legionaries.

We may now integrate his Nobles into our Order and enforce Legion law there with Amadeo giving liberals and socialists three days to flee. Though the question of how to reward Amadeo remains... we could grant him Sardinia as a Duchy though as we are aware he would likely be a more liberal leader than we prefer, so we could simply make it a titular title and grant him wealth. Or we could give him the prestige of being in charge of a Legion garrison though again he would likely be too tied to modern forms of warfare."

This failed of course but due to our reputation they decided to fight to the last man and women which made it especially costly to us, with the event already being called the Pillage of Catanzaro. More pressingly however the revolt only seemed to get out of hand because local soldiers decided to retreat instead of fighting them as ordered by their legionary commanders! We will need to set a precendent to make sure this does not happen again. The most popular proposal is to revive the Roman practice of decimatio, in which all of the disobedient soldiers will draw from a lottery and the ten percent who get the "losing straws" will be beaten to death by their comrades.
