#Entente Allies
NEE_entente_allies:0 "Supporting the Entente"
NEE_entente_allies_desc:0 "Our ties to Canada means we are a member of the Entente - whether we like it or not. The British have a great deal of experience and technology, however, which we can use to considerable advantage - though the more we do so, the more we lose legitimacy as a separate and distinct government."

#Reclaiming America

NEE_reclaiming_america_desc:0 "The Liberty Bell still rings in Boston even as other parts of our fair nation have torn themselves Asunder. Ever since the Canadian intervention which created our provisional government, we have hoped for democracy to win out in the civil war. If that is not the case, then we must steel ourselves to carry the torch for freedom, as the last vestige of democratic America."

#Defence Stratagem A
NEE_Defence_of_New_England:0 "Defence Stratagem A"
NEE_Defence_of_New_England_desc:0 "Our worst fears have come to be as the American Civil War is tearing up the nation from the coasts on the Pacific to the Texan oilfields to the smoking factories of the Great Lakes. We have only succeeded in escaping from the terror by the grace of the British Empire but even our future looks troubled as it is only a matter of time before the ideologically clashing blocs of the South look Northwards, ready to take back what they see as their rightful land.\n\nIt is for them that we must be prepared and defence systems must be created from the Hudson River to the streets of Boston. We may look weak on paper, but it will take every last drop of real American blood to take us down."

NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory:0 "Deploy the Anti-Air Defence System"
NEE_air_defence_of_the_territory_desc:0 "Modern War has shown the value of an airforce and the massive destruction it can cause upon the armies of old. Whilst we are desperately trying to keep in the air race, our industrial facilities are far smaller than those of our enemies which has prompted High Command to focus instead on the creation of an elaborate Anti-Air defence system capable of nullifying the air superiority of our opponents."

NEE_hudson_line:0 "Fortify the Hudson Line"
NEE_hudson_line_desc:0 "Flowing down towards the great city of New York, the Hudson river is of great value to any would be defender. Placing §YBunkers§! on its river banks may prove to be of great value in stopping the Southern threat."

NEE_connecticut_line:0 "Fall back to the Connecticut River"
NEE_connecticut_line_desc:0 "Whilst our main defence line lies on the Hudson river, one must always prepare for the unforeseen and as such we should consider creating a line of equal strength behind the Connecticut River. They may have gotten the better of us at the Hudson, but their offence stops here!"

NEE_boston_last_stand:0 "Our Last Stand"
NEE_boston_last_stand_desc:0 "The rivers have been breached and enemy troops are flooding the New Englander countryside. Boston still stands yet general evacuation of its civilian population has already been decreed. "It may seem that the war is turning against us, but the men and women of Boston shall not go gently into the night. We are the last bastion of American democracy; their last hope and it is here that this madness stops!"
NEE_last_stand_tt:0 "3 Divisions of §GNew Englander Volunteers§! will spawn in §YBoston§! to defend the city\n"

#Sway Public Opinion
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion:0 "Establishing Legitimacy"
NEE_Sway_Public_Opinion_desc:0 "We are a government that has been put into place by a foreign power - and thus many are keen to disregard our right to exist, or to call us traitors for not weighing in on the civil war raging in the rest of the nation. We must combat the opinion that we serve British interests rather than American citizens, and that involves changing attitudes at home. Failure to do so means the eventual dissolution of our government once the civil war is finished - or worse.\n\nCurrent Legitimacy :  §G[?NEE.NEE_legitimacy]§!"

NEE_national_propaganda_campaign:0 "Organise a Propaganda Campaign"
NEE_national_propaganda_campaign_desc:0 "Billboards, Radio Commercials, Newspaper Ads and much more, all will be pushed down the people’s throats in the hopes of conveying our message."

NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour:0 "Hold a Presidential Goodwill Tour"
NEE_presidential_goodwill_tour_desc:0 "Even as our propaganda ministry works around the clock, the man on the street remains unconvinced that actual power is wielded in Boston and sees the "president" as nothing more than a Canadian sock puppet happily following all orders from Ottawa. By touring the president and the elected cabinet around New England we hope to further convince the people that their real president and leader is very much [NEE.GetLeader]"

NEE_bribe_foreign_press:0 "'Motivate' the Foreign Press"
NEE_bribe_foreign_press_desc:0 "Journalists from all sides of the world keep having this annoying habit of reporting news within our nation as matters of the 'New Englander' state with socialist-aligned papers even going so far as calling us the Canadian Province of New England. This will no longer do for we will not be trifled with and they shall soon recognise that the only true American nation is ours. For now, however we'll have to be content with sliding some money towards the largest troublemakers and politely requesting that they call us the United States of America."

NEE_foreign_representation:0 "Increase Foreign Representation in R&D"
NEE_foreign_representation_desc:0 "The war may be raging harder than ever before but American scientists are still working in the labs and engineering facilities of the Ivy League universities. Let's make it clear that [Root.GetNameDef] has the wherewithal to innovate and stand on its own among the world leaders."

NEE_labour_relation_act:0 "Pass the Labour Relation Act"
NEE_labour_relation_act_desc:0 "A key source of the chaos to the south was the unmitigated exploitation of the working class by the elite. We need to avoid this occurring here by protecting workers' rights"

#Freedom Fliers
NEE_Dropping_Propaganda:0 "The 'Freedom Fliers'"
NEE_Dropping_Propaganda_desc:0 "The airplane has not only revolutionised the way we travel, transport goods or even wage warfare but also the ways with which we can spread our messages. Through the use of balloons, bombers and even just your regular fighter, the Freedom Fliers initiative has been tasked with flying deep over enemy territory to wage not the physical but the psychological war hoping to disrupt the minds of those that may not fully be on board with the nation they are fighting for."

NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda:0 "Choosing our Message"
NEE_Choosing_our_Propaganda_desc:0 "Even though there is an agreement that the Freedom Fliers should depart for the skies, dispute still rules in the ministry of propaganda as the search for the 'perfect' message knows no end and designers are sent back to the drawing board."

NEE_prop_choice_made:0 "We have chosen our §YMessage§!"

#Liberty Ship Project

NEE_Liberty_Ship_Program_desc:0 "With war on the European continent inevitable and with the Ententes ambitions to execute the largest naval operation in the history of mankind, the dockyards of New England are working overtime to meet the increasing needs of the alliance. To further boost our output, a centralised construction scheme has been created by the government to guide the further expansion of these shipyards."

NEE_thenewenglandconstitution:0 "The New England Constitution"
NEE_thenewenglandconstitution_desc:0 "The first order of business and the most important of the Second Hartford Convention shall be the nature of New England's Constitution. While many favor simply formally recognizing the US Constitution as our guiding charter others among Clarence Pickett's followers believe that the US Constitution did not go far enough in ensuring the welfare and prosperity of all Americans."
NEE_dissolvetheconvention:0 "Dissolve the Convention"
NEE_dissolvetheconvention_desc:0 "The Convention has failed! Cooler heads did not prevail and New England is on the path to anarchy! Oh, the humanity!"
NEE_iamprovidence:0 "I AM PROVIDENCE"
NEE_iamprovidence_desc:0 "I am Providence, & Providence is myself—together, indissolubly as one, we stand thro’ the ages; a fixt monument set aeternally in the shadow of Durfee’s ice-clad peak!  It is New England I must have—in some form or other."
NEE_newenglishheritage:0 "Teutonic Heritage"    
NEE_newenglishheritage_desc:0 "It is time to cast ourselves from the Fallen States. The chaos engulfing the rest of the country has demonstrated that the only way forward for New England is to forge a new path free from the pitfalls of the old America. A new chapter shall begin, under the watchful eye of Providence!"
NEE_breakboston:0 "Break Boston"
NEE_breakboston_desc:0 "The greatest impediment to New England’s revival is former Governor of Massachusetts and Mayor of Boston, the Irish hyphenate, James Michael Curley. He remains a fixture in Massachusetts politics, and his Sinn Feiners intimidate venal and vote-craving politicians into opposing Providence in our most populous state. These Irish malcontents must be dealt with."
NEE_theoirishquestion:0 "The Irish Question"
NEE_theoirishquestion_desc:0 "Governor Curley aroused great passions in Boston and the other Irish immigrant communities of New England. They are brainless canaille! The ‘Irish Republic’ committed an international crime against that friendly power and motherland whose continued friendship means more to civilization than anything else. They and the Reds tore England apart at the seams. They must be dealt with once and for all."
NEE_pushagainstthedarkness:0 "Push Against the Darkness"
NEE_pushagainstthedarkness_desc:0 "An unspeakable evil has come to America in the last days of the Fall. It slithers and oozes through the streets and out of doorways. It is the red plague of Syndicalism and those who would tolerate it, already enveloping and destroying the great cities of marble and stone that our ancestors built in the Old World. The decline of the Teutonic world ends today. The line must be drawn here! This far! No further!"
NEE_providentialeducation:0 "Providential Education"
NEE_providentialeducation_desc:0 "All nations must take steps to guarantee such pivotal forces as education, large-scale publishing, legal interpretation, criticism, dramatic management, artistic control, etc. are in the hands of those who inherit the respective culture-traditions of those nations. New England's Culture-Tradition is Providence and Providence is New England."
NEE_lovecraftbooks:0 "Lovecraft's Literature"
NEE_lovecraftbooks_desc:0 "Many New Englanders are already readers of Lovecraft’s literature and Americans from across the country flocked to Rhode Island in the days before the Fall. But more can still be reached! Providence has selected a curated list of books to be promoted in the country’s schools in order to combat decades of alien influence."
NEE_purgetheimpure:0 "Purge the Unclean"
NEE_purgetheimpure_desc:0 "The question is: do New Englanders desire to remain a vigorous, clean-moraled Teutonic-Celtic people; or do they desire to transform their country into a sordid, amorphous chaos of degradation and hybridism like imperial Rome? Providence must destroy not only his outspoken opponents, but the lukewarm, the opportunists, the heretical and bastardized; all who bear the stamp of the Fallen Age."
NEE_expandtheprovidenceguard:0 "Expand the Providence Guard"
NEE_expandtheprovidenceguard_desc:0 "Lovecraft’s most faithful followers were essential in the march from Providence that brought him to power in Hartford, but they’ve been rudderless since the Convention, patiently awaiting their leader’s commands. These loyal footsoldiers should be organized for the defense of New England in a new form."
NEE_establishdeltagreen:0 "Establish Delta Green"
NEE_establishdeltagreen_desc:0 "Deception is a right. Truth is a privilege. Innocence is a luxury. Noisome monstrosities lurk in the dark corners of the Earth. Syndicalists, the saboteurs of civilization, hide within our towns and cities. If Providence is to protect New England, he needs men who will do what is necessary to protect it. For that purpose, he has founded Delta Green, an agency with far broader authority than the old FBI."


NEE_buildtheeconomy:0 "Build the Economy"
NEE_buildtheeconomy_desc:0 "Though we have remained isolated from the war thus far, we cannot avoid the effect it has had on the American economy. Many of our citizens are out of work, and have been since the Great Depression. We must reassure the people that New England will take every step necessary to rebuild what we have lost."
NEE_theeducationreformbill:0 "The Education Reform Bill"
NEE_theeducationreformbill_desc:0 "New England was the heart of the modern American Academy. America’s fall does not require a change in policy. Education should be made widely available at the high school and elementary level. Though... perhaps we should take a look at the material, lest another generation be seduced by revolutionary syndicalism."
NEE_supporttheivyleague:0 "Support the Ivy League"
NEE_supporttheivyleague_desc:0 "Two of the three 'Big Ivies' - Harvard and Yale - lie within our control, with the Miskatonic University poised to soon replace the third. We must support the scholars at these high-level universities in the development of new technology."
NEE_expandtheeducationsystem:0 "Expand the Education System"
NEE_expandtheeducationsystem_desc:0 "Higher education in the august halls of our institutions has been the province of the upper crust of New England society. While it’s probably best that it remain this way, there’s no reason we cannot spend some of the state’s largesse on improving the schools in the poor ghettos and rural communities which dot the countryside."
NEE_maritimetrade:0 "Maritime Trade"
NEE_maritimetrade_desc:0 "Many international firms are (understandably) terrified of investing in America after the events of the last few years. With low investment opportunities on the mainland, we must instead look towards the Atlantic and maritime trade as the new driving force of the economy."
NEE_libertyshipsdockproject:0 "Liberty Ships Dock Project"
NEE_libertyshipsdockproject_desc:0 "With war on the European Continent inevitable and with the Entente's ambitions to execute the largest naval operation in the history of mankind, the dockyards of New England are working overtime to meet the increasing needs of the alliance. By pivoting our economy towards maritime industry we can both meet the increasing demands of the Entente and significantly improve our economic standing."
NEE_reintroducewhaling:0 "Re-introduce Whaling"
NEE_reintroducewhaling_desc:0 "The loss of the Texan oilfields and the already dire fuel situation of the Entente are forcing our hand in the ever-continuing search to find a reliable source of oil. New England has a proud whaling tradition, and by reintroducing it we may simultaneous find a method of alleviating the petroleum crisis and create a new market for consumer goods."
NEE_entrepreneurialspirit:0 "Entrepreneurial Spirit"
NEE_entrepreneurialspirit_desc:0 "The first pioneers of America were our Pilgrim forebears, striking out on their own in a New World and surviving by their own wits. The guiding hand of Providence ensured their survival, and eventually their flourishing. The government need not involve itself in business, give the pioneering entrepreneur a free hand and God will guide them."
NEE_americancapitalism:0 "American Capitalism"
NEE_americancapitalism_desc:0 "Capitalism was the lifeblood of the United States and shall be the savior of New England. The traitors to the south seek to destroy it, and with it the American way of life. We must preserve Life, Liberty, and Property Rights for all true Americans."
NEE_encourageinvestment:0 "Encourage Investment"
NEE_encourageinvestment_desc:0 "Most of the great industrialists and tycoons of New York who escaped the red wave ended up in New England or Canada. While many are understandably afraid of encroaching syndicalism, our northern benefactor serves as a guarantee of investment. All we need do is create an attractive environment for their business."
NEE_smallbusinesssubsidies:0 "Small Business Subsidies"

### Setting up New England ###

newengland.1.t:0 "The Occupation of New England"
newengland.1.d:0 "The outbreak of civil war in America has left the New England region only lightly-defended and vulnerable to occupation. If we strike quickly and seize the region, we could close a weak point on our eastern flank and strengthen our position against any invasion from a hostile southern power. All but abandoned by their government, we anticipate our New England cousins will welcome our intervention."
newengland.1.a:0 "Seize New England!"
newengland.1.b:0 "It is too risky"

newengland.2.t:0 "Canada Seizes New England"
newengland.2.d:0 "In response to the outbreak of civil war in America, Canadian forces have marched into New England and seized control of the entire lightly-defended region. While they claim this is in the interests of safeguarding innocent lives from the spread of chaos, more cynical members of our government suggest the Canadians are guarding their weak eastern flank in preparation for a possible war with [CSA.GetNameDef] should it prove victorious. Either way, it is clear that Canada has no interests in consulting either the American government or its people, and our sovereignty has been utterly violated."
newengland.2.a:0 "This is an act of war"
newengland.2.b:0 "We will respond later"

newengland.3.t:0 "Terror in New England"
newengland.3.d:0 "With syndicalist forces sitting right on their doorstep, the people of New England are terrified that the Federal government won't be able to prevent a rapid takeover of the entire area. There was a brief hope that Canadian forces might intervene, but it appears that they've refused out of fear of insulting our government. As a result, militia groups in Boston are rapidly mobilizing to try and organize a proper defence of the area."
newengland.3.a:0 "We'll help as much as we're able"
newengland.3.b:0 "Quietly urge Canada to intervene anyhow..."
CAN_goes_ahead_with_int:0 "Canada will go ahead with intervention on American soil..."

newengland.5.t:0 "Our own America"
newengland.5.d:0 "We have taken control of the northeastern American region known as New England. Now that we have done so, a number of ministers have met with leaders from those states to set up a provisional government. They would be our own piece of America, and should the civil war spill northwards, we will have our own ally on the border that we can influence. Of course, some also think we should just occupy and administer the land without worrying about a middleman of suspect loyalty to the Crown."
newengland.5.a:0 "Set up the Puppet Government"
newengland.5.b:0 "Set up the Puppet Government (Play as New England)"
newengland.5.c:0 "Continue with military occupation"

newengland.6.t:0 "The Provisional government of New England"
newengland.6.d:0 "Thanks to our allies in Canada, we are now protected from the red menace coming from Chicago and New York City. We have set up a provisional government in Boston as we prepare to liberate the rest of our country. Unfortunately, not many people both in and out of the states in New England believe that we are the true and legitimate America, and we must rectify this problem."
newengland.6.a:0 "Don't tread on me!"

newengland.7.t:0 "America is Reunited"
newengland.7.d:0 "At long last America has been reunited. We stretch once again from sea to shining sea. The traitors to the country have been destroyed and the stars and stripes now fly proudly from coast to coast knowing that liberty is secured for all."

newengland.10.d:0 "A bill has come before to help improve the conditions of the workers within America.

newengland.10.a:0 "Pass the Act"
newengland.10.b:0 "Do Not Pass the Act"

newengland.11.t:0 "Labor-Relations Act"
newengland.11.d:0 "A bill has come before to help improve the conditions of the economy and workplace. The so-called Labor-Relations Act is obviously designed to help the businesses over the workers. And thus, it is facing push-back from the more liberal members of Congress that believe it does not go far enough. So, the question is will congress pass the bill or not."
newengland.11.a:0 "Pass the Act"
newengland.11.b:0 "Do not Pass the Act"

newengland.12.t:0 "New England Demands Home Rule"
newengland.12.d:0 "The New England provisional government, now that it has established its military and structure, has demanded that it be granted home rule. Some members of the Canadian government are taken aback by the tone of the demand, seeing as the Canadian government is what enabled New Englanders to avoid the chaos rampant in the rest of America, though others (perhaps rightly) point out that unless Canada's ambition is to govern Americans as colonial subjects there is no reason not to give New England what it seeks."
newengland.12.a:0 "Grant them home rule"
newengland.12.b:0 "No, they are too valuable"

newengland.13.t:0 "Canada Agrees"
newengland.13.d:0 "The Canadian government has responded to our demand in the affirmative. They are ready to relinquish all control over our government apparatus, and have expressed williness to work with us as equal partners in the Entente alliance."
newengland.13.a:0 "We are grateful"

newengland.14.t:0 "Canada Refuses"
newengland.14.b:0 "Perhaps deciding that we are too valuable an asset in their quest to retake the Home Isles, or perhaps secretly coveting New England's territory as their own, the Canadian government has refused to grant Ne England home rule. We are, at least for the foreseeable future, their subject...something which has provided a serious blow to our government's legitimacy."
newengland.14.a:0 "This is an outrage!"

newengland.15.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Declares Independence"
newengland.15.d:0 "Chafing ever since we refused them home rule, the New England government has finally declared its independence, abandoning our alliance entirely."

newengland.40.d:0 "What was first considered a non-issue, the Yankee Clipper Hurricane arrived on Long Island September 21st and would only a few hours later turn out to be largest Hurricane to set foot in New England since the Great Colonial Hurricane of 1635.\n\nMoving North from Long Island to Connecticut, Rhode Island and up through Vermont the storm cost the lives of close to 700 people. By the end of the devastation over 57,000 homes were destroyed or damaged and road networks all across the New England region lay in tatters with projections estimating that it would take us months or even years just to re-open them to traffic."
newengland.40.a:0 "God save us all"

newengland.41.t:0 "Road integration with Canada?"
newengland.41.d:0 "As we continue building up our economy and expanding the road network, the question arose of which direction we should drive on. While the custom in America has always been to drive on the right Canada has, since the British revolution in 1925, driven on the left.\n\nSome political leaders have suggested that we switch to driving on the Left in an attempt to better integrate our road network into the Canadian one whilst others of course wish to stay driving on the right to further amplify that New England is not a British Dominion."
newengland.41.a:0 "We shall adapt to the British model"
newengland.41.b:0 "American cars drive on the side of Freedom!"

The visit was more then just seeing the sites of the sites for they also came to discuss politics with the various leaders of note in New England."

### Underground Railroad ###
newengland.50.t:0 "The Underground Railroad"
newengland.50.d:0 "Established in the 1700s, the first Underground Railroad served as a network of secret routes with as purpose to clandestinely transport Afro-American slaves from the Thirteen Colonies into Canada where slavery was already abolished.\n\nWith the American Civil War tearing apart households across the Americans and ideological strive leading to the forced expulsion or sometimes even massacre of Americans, our government has reignited the old "Railroad" and has with the aid of locals on both sides of the border re-established the network with the hopes of safely transporting refugees to our little nation."
newengland.50.a:0 "There is only so much we can do though..."

#CSA
newengland.51.t:0 "The Lake Erie Migration Crisis"
newengland.51.d:0 "The war has only been raging for a few weeks now as federalists and syndicalists fight it out around the Great Lakes. As comrade shoots comrade and the battlelines shift in both directions, one can not forget the tremendous loss of civilian life.\n\nOften caught in the midst of battle, decimated in bombing raids or executed by fanatics of either side, these people have been fleeing en-masse from the fighting towards our nation. As the land route is becoming more dangerous by the day, vast swathes of shaky tubs have been spotted on Lake Erie in a desperate attempt to reach our peaceful sanctuary. The condition of these rafts is often so dire that many don't even make it across the border, let alone into our safe hands. Relief organisations such as United America and the Red Cross have flocked to the coastline of the lake to help those that survive the perilous journey, often undertaken under cover of the night. They now ask that the government provides them with more means to rescue those coming across and to sweep our side of the lake for survivors.\n\nPragmatists in the Army however have seen an opportunity in this Great Migration to smuggle weaponry and equipment from the CSA into our hands. They propose that we send covert agents to Detroit and Cleveland who will then smuggle the goods on the refugee rafts towards our patrol boats."
newengland.51.a:0 "Allow covert operatives to establish a base on Pelee Island"

newengland.52.t:0 "Successful Smuggling Operation on Lake Erie"
newengland.52.d:0 "Tucked away beneath sheets of linen and between the clothes of refugees, our covert operatives on the syndicalist side of Lake Erie have been able to successfully smuggle small arms, munition, medical supplies. Even heavier equipment such as artillery shells and dismantled mortars have been carried across by efforts of our, American, people being nothing short of heroic. Thus far the Syndies suspect nothing but it would seem only natural that one day our luck will run out..."
newengland.52.a:0 "Piece by piece we pick away at the syndicalist carcass"

newengland.53.t:0 "Smugglers apprehended!"
newengland.53.d:0 "Our good fortune couldn't last and yesterday was once again further proof of this. Although nothing seemed out of the ordinary on the smuggler boats, a slight deviation on the schedule of the Cleveland harbour patrol caught our operatives in the midst of the crime. Words could not explain why there were dozens of ammo chests and carabines on an unmarked vessel and it didn't take long until the boat was brought back to shore and our agents locked behind bars."
newengland.53.a:0 "Change the course of the routes, we can not stop the operation!"
newengland.53.b:0 "It's too risky, we should focus on the refugee program"

newengland.54.t:0 ""Jack" the Doberman"
newengland.54.d:0 "As man falls back into his usual routine of killing his neighbours, the animal world is not spared from the violence either. A happy story however emerged from Connecticut where a young Doberman, ironically enough named Jack, was able to stop syndicalist agents from blowing up a bomb in Hartford.\n\nThe dog was training in cooperation with the Connecticut National Guard when his patrol spotted the syndicalists who promptly tried to escape from capture. With the courage of a true American, the little dog immediately ran after them and pulled one of the two men down leading to his capture. This man later turned out to be none other than Paul Rashford, a target long sought after by the Hartford Police Department for his implication in the syndicalist riots only a few months earlier and who seems to have established a whole network of syndicalist operatives in Connecticut.\n\nWhilst his capture by no means marks the end of the socialist threat in the state, 'Jack' has dealt a heavy blow to their leadership."
newengland.54.a:0 "We express our thanks to this good boy!"

newengland.55.t:0 "Refugees from the CSA"
newengland.55.d:0 "The horrors of war keep raging in the Combined Syndicates of America and the large migratory wave from theirs into our territory seems to know no end.

newengland.57.t:0 "Pelley asserts control in the AUS"
newengland.57.d:0 "It came as no surprise to the people of America that Huey Long served only as a tool for the far more dangerous Pelley. Today the power struggle within the leadership of the Union State finally came to a head as Pelley himself has officially been sworn in as President and has already started to implement his policies of far-reaching racism and his wishes to achieve a White Christian Nation.\n\nIt goes without saying that the response to these events in the Black Belt has been far from welcoming as hundreds of thousands of Afro-American citizens now fear for their future and look North to us in the hopes of finding a safe haven far away from Pelley’s cronies."
newengland.57.a:0 "We have no place for them either!"
newengland.57.b:0 "Install strict refugee quotas and only allow a select few in"
newengland.57.c:0 "In Boston one is not discriminated for the colour of his skin!"

newengland.58.t:0 "Unchecked Migration"
newengland.58.d:0 "What started as a few hundred, rapidly became tens of thousands as Pelley’s anti-black policy has scared the Afro-American citizens northwards into our territory. Border guards are unable to keep up with the increasing amount of refugees and government institutions and relief organisations are struggling to provide shelter and food to those who have lost their home. We need to step in and do so now or we will risk our own nation collapsing under the weight of these people who more often than not have used all their resources to make it to our border.\n\nA hard choice will have to be made between restricting the amount of refugees coming and thus leaving them at the mercy of Pelley’s regime in the South or to let them all freely cross the border and risk straining our own nation. Relief organisations like United America have already denounced certain political figures who have spoken out against the unchecked migration but even they are now realizing that resources are rapidly decreasing, and the flood keeps increasing."
newengland.58.a:0 "Close the Border!"
newengland.58.b:0 "We are the only hope these people have, let them in!"

newengland.59.t:0 "Appointing the New England Poet laureate"
newengland.59.d:0 "The position of Poet laureate has been discussed within state politics for a few years now. A single person to represent the corpus of hundreds of artists against the tide of film and popular music as an art form. The New England congress has decided to create this title along with a re-consecration of the Boston Athenæum as the temporary Library of Congress. The top candidate in the congressional poll is Robert Frost, who exhibits a distinctly New England mastery of modernist poetry. Public polls, however, has shown favor for the Robert Lowell, a young writer whose themes concern life in Massachusetts and Boston in particular, speaking to the New English soul. The Library of Congress is in a bind."

newengland.60.d:0 "The private life of President Winant is not the proper subject of newspaper gossip, but after today, it is a public issue. President Winant's minders found a loaded gun in his bedroom tonight, and after a panic determined their was no intended assassin. President Winant confessed to his minders that his secret affair with Sarah Churchill ended, and he is distraught over the potential political fallout for indiscretions with a major Canadian politician's daughter. Fortunately, Winston Churchill was very gently notified, and forgave President Winant in person. Winant has decided to take a few days break to recuperate mentally."

newengland.61.d:0 "Long before his career in politics, Peter Gerry was a student at Harvard. There, he was tutored by Canadian Deputy Minister of Labor William Lyon King. These lessons had a major impact on Gerry.  Now, King is a major Liberal politician whose allies stateside are the Republicans and the Liberals. As a President, Gerry has talked with his advisors about crossing the party line to help his old mentor. This would invariably debase the Democrats, and aid the Liberals in America. "

newengland.62.d:0 "A massive fire erupted in the popular Boston nightclub, Cocoanut Grove, leaving almost 500 people dead. Among the victims are several high ranking American immigrants, and the uproar searching for an answer has raced the highest halls of power. It appears that several mid-level Democratic party politicians had taken bribes earlier this month before an inspection. This inspection was independently determined to be insufficient, and the public prosecutor is preparing a case aledging massive conspiracy. This has rocked public support for Democrats across New England."

When these relics of a peaceful America arrived, we were all ashamed to find them defaced. It appears Diego Rivera, whose murals were rejected for installation, took it upon himself to replace images of Zeus with Marx.

### Freedom Fliers ###
newengland.70.t:0 "Choosing our Propaganda"
newengland.70.d:0 "The "Freedom Fliers" initiative has been activated by our government but there is still much discussion about the content of the dropped messages as the right message could wreak havoc behind their lines but the wrong message could further bolster their resolve.\n\nWhether to strike the civilian population or the armed forces directly also remains a topic for debate as some have argued that the enemy homefront would be more susceptible to our message but a direct strike on their armed forces could lead to a more direct effect."

newengland.71.t:0 "The Tale of Private Bob 'Daredevil' Rogers"
newengland.71.d:0 "Private Bob had always been a well-known name in the corps of the Freedom Fliers but it was his recent heroic actions above syndicalist territory that earned him his nickname 'Daredevil'.\n\nSent out with 5 other members of his squadron, he and his compatriots got surprised by a CSA anti air installation that had been placed there after rumours of incursions into their air zone. Bad intel on our part ultimately led to disaster as the entire group of planes was shredded to pieces with only Private Bob and one of his crew mates surviving the crash. Landing deep behind enemy lines and with no way to reach our own positions, the two men took it upon themselves to perform a series of guerilla actions in the region, achieving critical success in hindering syndicalist supply lines and successfully forcing their command to deploy further troops to the region.\n\nTheir success would however not continue much longer as an attempt to recruit possible sympathizers amidst the civilian population backfired and a setup orchestrated to finally kill the two men led to the death of Bobs fellow soldier and the loss of his right ear.\n\nNow alone, out of ammunition and still with no way to return to base, Bob traveled all the way North to Lake Erie whilst always staying one step ahead of the syndicalist agents tracking him down.\n\nEmbarking with 50 refugees on a shaky vessel, Bob finally made it back into New York last week. Having been stuck alone with no contact deep behind enemy lines, it took the brave man 50 days to make his way back into our country leaving a trail of sabotage in his wake. Although granted leave by his commanding officers to recover from his adventure, Bob has reportedly already signed up for the next flight claiming that he would do it all over again for his beloved nation."
newengland.71.a:0 "The American nation thanks her son for his service!"

newengland.72.t:0 "Further Expansion of the 'Freedom Fliers'"
newengland.72.d:0 "Recent successes with the Corps have prompted many to question whether the planes should also be used to perform air drops behind enemy lines to supply the resistance cells with weapons and further equipment. Some have argued however that this deviates too far from the original peaceful mission of the Freedom Fliers and that the extra equipment and manpower necessary for the operations might very well be better spend elsewhere."
newengland.72.a:0 "Assign them the resources!"

newengland.73.t:0 "Sabotage on the Bedford Army Air Field"
newengland.73.d:0 "Under cover of darkness and with support from within, foreign operatives have succeeded in causing massive damage to the fighter planes stationed in Bedford. Dozens of planes have been lost or damaged and the hangars have suffered from various small explosions. We have thus far been unable to stop them and there isn't even an answer as to which faction the saboteurs adhere."
newengland.73.a:0 "Are we blind? Deploy the Garrison!"

newengland.80.t:0 "The Yankee Rebellion"
newengland.80.d:0 "While our intention upon occupying New England was to safeguard the locals from the ravages of the American Civil War, it seems many of them have taken exception. Several leaders in Boston have publicly accused Canada of desiring solely to return the area to British rule, to squeeze whatever we can out of the region so that we can return to the Home Isles, and that they would have been better off throwing their lot in with their American brothers and sisters. The fever pitch in the area has reached the point where we may have to reconsider our plan for New England self-government... or face a long period of uprisings."

newengland.82.t:0 "The Yankee Resistance"
newengland.82.d:0 "The rebellion in New England continues, this time with a group referring to itself as the 'Yankee Resistance' setting off explosives in several major areas. The resulting damage and panic has made for a headache, and calls for Canada to end its occupation have redoubled in force."
newengland.82.a:0 "Would they prefer to be in a civil war?!"

newengland.83.t:0 "Canadian Troops Attacked"
newengland.83.d:0 "Several military installations within the New England area have been attacked by the 'Yankee Resistance' - not enough to cause real damage, but enough to draw the notice of the newspapers and the public, keeping the occupation in the public eye far longer than we'd like."
newengland.83.a:0 "How annoying"

newengland.84.t:0 "Major Attack in [attack.GetName]"
newengland.84.d:0 "A major attack in [attack.GetName] by Yankee Resistance forces has left several hundred injured and a public debacle which has put the New England occupation in the Canadian news spotlight once again. The disruption in [attack.GetName] has been considerable, and [attack.GetName] newspapers are filled with headlines about how New Englanders should have fought in the civil war - going so far as to call siding with the Canadians a form of cowardice. There is pushback from many sides, but the rebellion continues to be a headache for Canadian occupation forces."
newengland.84.a:0 "Hopefully this will end at some point"

newengland.85.t:0 "Yankee Rebellion Over"
newengland.85.d:0 "It has taken many months, but it appears the so-called Yankee Rebellion in New England is over. Resistance leaders have either been captured or fled, and the remaining local governments all seem to be on board with the Canadian government - spurred on, one imagines, by the pictures of devastation throughout the rest of America playing across their newspaper pages.

There was little time to discuss the matter in Boston, however, as almost instantly a public campaign swept across the country demanding we dissolve the government at once.

newengland.90.d.choice:0 "Officials arrived today from [From.GetNameDef] to begin negotiations about a peaceful reunion between our government and theirs, now that the civil war is over and the victor decided. There are many who feel that the main purpose of New England's provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - has been served, and we should become part of America once again. There are others, however, who feel that New England has achieved its own sense of legitimacy. We have a place in the British sphere, and is being a part of [From.GetNameDef] what we truly want? Are they truly the America we remember?"
newengland.90.a:0 "It seems we have no choice but to agree..."

Now that the civil war is done, they believe the purpose of New England's provisional government - namely to avoid the chaos and destruction - is also passed. America, they say, must be one once more. There is a mixed reaction within the government, though most agree that [requester.GetNameDef] will not sit idly by should we refuse."
newengland.91.a:0 "Then we wish them well"
newengland.91.b:0 "We agree, if [requester.GetNameDef] joins the Entente"

newengland.93.t:0 "Reunion with New England"
newengland.93.d:0 "Officials from New England delivered the message promptly: they will gladly unite with [Root.GetNameDef] at once. The purpose of their provisional government - to avoid the chaos of the civil war - is now over with, and they look forward to America being whole once again."
newengland.93.a:0 "Excellent!"

newengland.94.t:0 "The Canadian Concern"
newengland.94.d:0 "While the New England government is not a Canadian puppet, it would be false to suggest that it wasn't part of the British Empire - such as it is - and of great concern to the larger Canadian sphere of interest. The Canadian government is willing to allow New England to reunite with [requester.GetNameDef], since the reason for Canada's intervention in the region ended with the civil war, but they are asking that [requester.GetNameDef] join the Entente alliance. This would make up for New England's loss, and also be a way to pay back [CAN.GetNameDef] for saving American lives."
newengland.94.a:0 "We'll see where this goes..."
newengland.94.b:0 "We're fine with that request"
newengland.94.c:0 "No, they have no right to make that demand"

newengland.95.a:0 "Might amenable of them!"

newengland.96.t:0 "[requester.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.96.d:0 "Officials from [requester.GetNameDef] have returned to Canada with a flat refusal - they will not bargain for New England's return, particularly since [CAN.GetNameDef] had no right to intervene in the civil war in the first place. The officials say that Canada took control of New England to safeguard themselves against the syndicalists, nothing more. With that threat gone, America should once again be whole."
newengland.96.a:0 "I wish mommy and daddy would stop fighting..."
newengland.96.b:0 "Very well, let them go"
newengland.96.c:0 "Then we refuse"

newengland.97.t:0 "[From.GetNameDefCap] Refuses"
newengland.97.d.forced:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham. Since the New England lacks sufficient legitimacy to act as anything but a Canadian puppet, it has dissolved in a spasm of in-fighting and fury against the Canadians."
newengland.97.d.choice:0 "The Canadian government has returned to New England with a flat refusal - we may not rejoin America. It seems their promises of self-government, and their assurances that the intervention was for our safety, were all simply a sham: they intervened to safeguard British interests, nothing more.

###The Convention###

newengland.101.t:0 "The Second Hartford Convention"
newengland.101.d:0 "With New England under Canadian protection, the first order of business remains the establishment of a legitimate government in this time of crisis, and the reaffirmation and recognition of the Constitution of the United States as the primary source of law and authority in the nation. Leaders and statesmen are making their way to Connecticut, hoping to make history with their involvement in the preservation of America. Others, however, see the Convention as more than an opportunity to not reaffirm the Constitution, but a place to make crucial changes to the document to prevent yet another Civil War. These political dissidents have flocked to the immigrant-backed and Quaker-led alliance under Clarence Pickett or Lovecraft’s increasingly militant and outspoken Loyal Coalition. Canadian liberation has given us freedom and isolation from the Second American Civil War. Yet, with the Second Hartford Convention about to begin, the future of New England seems even more uncertain."
newengland.101.a:0 "New England sleeps..."

newengland.102.t:0 "The Rise of Lovecraft"
newengland.102.d:0 "During the Weltkrieg, untold thousands rushed to the relative safety, stability, and opportunity of America. As the war languished on, immigrants flooded New England, quickly and unexpectedly changing the face of the northeast. With these diverse, new interests came new problems: particularly, nativist resentment. These problems were only compounded by the economic recession that set in after the Kaiserreich began to isolate the United States of America. This discontent was championed by one of New England’s most famous personalities: the celebrity author, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. Lovecraft’s meteoric rise to fame in recent years is based on his tales of weird and diabolical fiction, seen by both fans and critics as giving voice to the xenophobia, economic insecurity, and reactionary instincts of New Englanders.\n\nInitially the darling of Boston Brahmins and New England’s Anglo-Saxon majority, Lovecraft’s work spread like wildfire across the country, turning him into an overnight sensation. The Shadow Over Innsmouth, one of Lovecraft's most famous novellas, deals obliquely with the threats of state conspiracy and invasion, as well as miscegenation and its monstrous consequences. Some of his most ardent followers swear that prophetic, astrological portents can be understood through comprehensive study of his work. Once a soft-spoken and shy man, Lovecraft has become a political voice for New England's increasingly disenfranchised WASP majority and was nominated leader of the reactionary and Anglo-centric Loyal Coalition. The Loyal Coalition is a political party which aims to bring America closer to the Anglosphere and defend New England against the ethnic hordes that have flooded its borders in recent decades."
newengland.102.a:0 "New England stirs..."

newengland.103.t:0 "The Quaker Alliance"
newengland.103.d:0 "Originally disregarded and laughed at by established politicians, Clarence Pickett’s Quaker Alliance has managed to gain a concerning amount of sway within New England. Pickett has brought the Religious Society of Friends (AKA ‘Quakers’) to the forefront of New English politics by offering unconditional support to immigrants and refugees alike, while working to change the church from a religious institution into an outspoken political party dedicated to international neutrality, pacifism, and Christian charity. Citing the progressive precedent set by the Roosevelt-administration and the teachings of Jesus Christ, Pickett has begun drafting a set of crucial amendments for New England’s Constitution. Deemed the “Appeal to Heaven,” the Quaker platform aims to transform New England into a welfare state that can open its arms to the downtrodden across the shattered American continent."
newengland.103.a:0 "Oatmeal, anyone?"

newengland.104.t:0 "Loyal Coalition Denied Representation"
newengland.104.d:0 "Referencing an unsettling resemblance to Long’s Minutemen and the Silver Legion of America, a Democratic-Republican power bloc under Joseph William Martin Jr. and James Michael Curley has denied Lovecraft’s Loyal Coalition representation in the Congress of New England and participation in the Second Hartford Convention. In response to what their leader has deemed “a desperate act by loathsome cowards” Lovecraft’s supporters have begun to gather in Providence, Rhode Island in anticipation of a march from Providence to Hartford in protest."
newengland.104.a:0 "Will they see the truth?"

newengland.105.t:0 "Blood on the Quinebaug"
newengland.105.d:0 "More nascent congressmen pour into Hartford, followed by stories of Lovecraft’s unyielding march from Providence. As thousands of angry nativists mustered towards Connecticut, a national guard unit was dispatched to the small town of Pomfret, Connecticut to halt the demonstration. When ordered to fire, most of the guardsmen refused and joined the demonstration. Those that complied were quickly overpowered by the Loyalists. As they crossed the Quinebaug River, Lovecraft is reported to have said the following: “A great foulness wishes to silence us. Send these vermin a message: the rightful owners of this country have returned, and their kind is no longer welcome here.”"
newengland.105.a:0 "Wondrous and terrifying..."

newengland.106.t:0 "The Democratic-Republican Bloc Fractures"
newengland.106.d:0 "Faced with the imminent threat of the Loyal Coalition and the growing influence of the Quakers, the power bloc formed by the Democrats and Republicans is quickly beginning to unravel. The Republicans, hosting a fair number of ex-Progressives within their midst, are quick to cite the oncoming Lovecraftians as a reason to compromise with the Quakers to regain stability. Meanwhile, the Democrats have begun an unsuccessful campaign to have the Quakers banned from the Congress by labeling them as “radical socialists” and syndicalist sympathizers. This schism has once again divided the two parties, with the Society of Friends pulling in the lion’s share of people and politicians alienated by current events."
newengland.106.a:0 "Splitters!"

newengland.107.t:0 "Convention or Disaster!"
newengland.107.d:0 "For better or ill, the time has finally come to gather the Congress and begin the Convention. With the Loyal Coalition mere miles from the city center and gaining ground quickly, a series of roadblocks and checkpoints is hastily erected to slow their advance. Reports abound of nativist mobs descending on these barriers to rip them apart with their bare hands before marching lines of uniformed Loyal Coalition members clear effortlessly through the wreckage. As attendance is counted among the Convention, only a thin a line of troops separates the Congress from Lovecraft’s impending arrival. If they can’t stop him, they need only delay him long enough for the Convention to be held."
newengland.107.a:0 "The line holds!"
newengland.107.b:0 "Lovecraft storms the Convention."

###Convention Choice###

newengland.108.t:0 "The Second Hartford Convention Begins"
newengland.108.d:0 "With the Lovecraftians delayed, the Second Hartford Convention can proceed. Assembled here are the men who will deliver New England from Syndicalism and Radicalism... Or so we hope. Even now, rifts are growing wider between the radically egalitarian Quakers, the conservative Democrats, and the business-minded Republicans. Will they be able to put aside their differences to form a stable government?"
newengland.108.a:0 "Let the arguing commence!"

newengland.109.t:0 "Lovecraft Storms the Convention"
newengland.109.d:0 "Lovecraftian loyalists tear open the doors of the State Capitol and pour into the Convention. They are careful not to destroy any of the statues or art lining the capitol building's halls, even as they begin forcibly removing members of the Convention who led the effort to bar the Loyalists from attending.\n\nIn walks Lovecraft, flanked by his young adherents. There is the perpetual, tight-lipped scowl which seems to the be hallmark of the author. And there is the penetrating gaze, staring into the delegates' very souls. He ascends to the podium of the Connecticut Senate chamber where the crowd of delegates has been corralled. While the contents of Lovecraft’s speech to the Convention were never recorded, those in attendence would later say that he delved into every topic, addressed every doubt, and appealed to the secret desires in the heart of every delegate, covering a week's worth of topics in less than two days. Some said Lovecraft spoke for almost thirty-six hours. And took questions for twelve more. Whatever truly happened in the Senate chambers, by the time he was done, Howard Phillips Lovecraft had been unanimously chosen as Provisional Leader of New England."
newengland.109.a:0 "Providence reigns supreme."

newengland.110.t:0 "The Constitution – Our System of Government"
newengland.110.d:0 "The Constitution of the United States of America is possibly the finest documents ever written… and yet out Republic has suffered two civil wars. The authors of the Constitution are the ancestors of some now in attendance, and it’s true that the Roman Republic survived its fair share of civil wars, but the Quaker Alliance argues that our Constitution’s fundamental unfairness has brought us to calamity. In their view, the Electoral College allows prejudiced and territorial leaders to maintain power and create fractures in the Republic. The Democratic-Republican Coalition has come out strongly against the destabilizing influence of broad democracy."

newengland.112.t:0 "Immigration and Opportunity"
newengland.112.d:0 "While many immigrants came to America during the Weltkrieg, this flood of newcomers has slowed in recent years as a result of the recession brought on by Germany’s economic isolation of the United States. This, in turn, has resulted in greater competition for fewer jobs between Americans and Immigrants. And Black Monday has only made things worse! The Republicans see immigration as a threat to New England’s stability; introducing alien philosophies like Syndicalism and Catholicism. The Democrats, though normally a conservative party, have benefited from the Irish community as a voter base in the Northeast. The Quakers, to the horror of everyone gathered, have suggested throwing open the doors of New England as a land of Christian charity and opportunity. And not just for Europeans, but for people fleeing war across the world!"
newengland.112.a:0 "The Republicans defend New England!"
newengland.112.b:0 "A Democratic compromise!"
newengland.112.c:0 "The Quakers are right!"

newengland.113.t:0 "A Balance of Power"
newengland.113.d:0 "Many blame the Second Civil War on the powers of the executive. Some argue that it was an executive with near-unlimited power that resulted in the violence. Others argue that a sufficiently powerful president could have destroyed the radical parties before they pushed our country to the brink of collapse. The Republicans advocate limiting the powers of the President and empowering Congress. The Democrats want to strengthen the President to deal with political malcontents. The Quaker Alliance wants to reduce the power of the president and allow people to live their lives as they see fit."
newengland.113.a:0 "Executive power is what got us into this mess!"
newengland.113.b:0 "The President can destroy Syndicalism and Populism!"
newengland.113.c:0 "Morality is more important than executive power."

newengland.114.t:0 "New England’s Army"
newengland.114.d:0 "The American military has languished during the 20th century. Most of the armies currently fighting the Second American Civil War are made up of militias and disorganized volunteers. While professional soldiery will always present the best defense, some argue that New England needs bodies more than it needs professionals. The Republicans advocate an elite, limited army with Canadian backing, while the Democrats demand widespread conscription to protect against Syndicalism. Pickett’s Quakers, in keeping with their Pacifist beliefs, have proposed a radical idea: complete disarmament and an open hand towards all. No one will want to attack New England if they know the New English do not present a danger."
newengland.114.a:0 "Limited conscription and defense!"
newengland.114.b:0 "Extensive conscription! Fight the Syndicalists!"
newengland.114.c:0 "Peace upon mankind forever! Forever!"

newengland.115.t:0 "The Judicial System"
newengland.115.d:0 "Despite claims to the contrary, the Supreme Court has long been a politicized body, and it is for this reason that American politicians have so frequently fought over justices and threatened to pack the court, like Jack Reed. The debate breaking the Democratic-Republican Coalition is whether the new President should be allowed to appoint all new justices, or whether each state should provide a new justice. The Republicans prefer to draft judges from each state. The Democrats favor the old system, likely because they believe their dominance of Massachusetts will allow them to carry the election. The Quaker Alliance has proposed a radical new plan of dissolving the Supreme Court and instead relying a completely federalized system of high courts in each state."
newengland.115.a:0 "Judges from each state!"
newengland.115.b:0 "It’s an executive power!"
newengland.115.c:0 "Who but God is Supreme?"

newengland.116.t:0 "Centralization or Decentralization"
newengland.116.d:0 "It’s a theme of the Convention’s debates. Do we trust our leaders to use this newfound power to protect us or will we limit them to ensure men like Long and Reed cannot plunge us into anarchy again? It’s most pressing in New England, because many of the delegations are led by state Governors... who until now have had independent authority. If one of their number wins the election, will the rest surrender power to this First Among Equals? The Republicans advocate preserving federalism as New England is only a temporary creation until America is reborn. The Democrats argue New England’s government needs more power if it’s going to rebuild America. The Quakers. . . question the very necessity of power. Trust is more important."
newengland.116.a:0 "Limit the executive!"
newengland.116.b:0 "Empower the executive!"
newengland.116.c:0 "Who needs an executive?"

newengland.117.t:0 "The Capital"
newengland.117.d:0 "While many hope that America will be reborn soon and we will all be able to celebrate in Washington D.C., our new government requires a central location for the time being. Many Governors are lobbying for the capitals of their own states, thinking it will give them an edge in the coming election."
newengland.117.a:0 "Boston, Massachusetts!"
newengland.117.b:0 "Providence, Rhode Island!"
newengland.117.c:0 "Buffalo, New York!"
newengland.117.e:0 "Hartford, Connecticut!"

newengland.118.t:0 "The Convention Ends"
newengland.118.d:0 "With the Second Hartford Convention finally at an end, we can only hope that we’ve made the right decisions to guide our fledgling nation. Despite all of the arguing and debating, people are breathing a sigh of relief. Whether it’s because they trust in our new Constitution or because they are happy not to be in the same room anymore is anyone’s guess."
newengland.118.a:0 "Let’s look to the future."

newengland.119.t:0 "A Provisional Leader"
newengland.119.d:0 "We cannot live in anarchy. We need a leader to run New England and organize our upcoming elections. Before the delegates left, they cast votes to elect a provisional leader. The choices were Joseph William Martin Jr., representing the Republican wing of the Convention, Governor Wilbur Lucius Cross, representing the Democratic wing of the Convention, and Clarence Pickett, representing the Quakers. Who won?"
newengland.119.a:0 "Joseph William Martin Jr."
newengland.119.b:0 "Wilbur Lucius Cross"
newengland.119.c:0 "Clarence Pickett"
newengland.119.e:0 "Democratic-Liberal-Republican Coalition!"

###Forming Dank Lovecraftian Utopia###

newengland.120.t:0 "The First Great Test"
newengland.120.d:0 "Lovecraft may have convinced the Convention, but it is our great, northern benefactor who will determine New England’s fate. Will the Canadians tolerate such a radical firebrand taking control of their erstwhile dependency? And what of the members of the U.S. military who chose to defend their home states in New England when the civil war broke out? Lovecraft’s royalist and English sympathies are well known, and it is likely he would give way to the Crown out of respect, but an uprising by New England’s paltry military is a different matter."
newengland.120.a:0 "Providence holds onto power."
newengland.120.b:0 "The Canadians intervene!"
newengland.120.c:0 "The army takes control!"

newengland.121.t:0 "Lovecraft Reigns Supreme"
newengland.121.d:0 "We must recognize the essential underlaying savagery in the animal called man, and return to older and sounder principles of national life and defense. We must realize that man's nature will remain the same so long as he remains man; that civilization is but a slight coverlet beneath which the dominant beast sleeps lightly and ever ready to awake. \n\nIn considering ourselves, we think too much of ethics and sociology - too little of plain natural history. The instincts that governed the Egyptians and the Assyrians of old, govern us as well; and as the ancients thought, grasped, struggled, and deceived, so shall we moderns continue to think, grasp, struggle, and deceive in our inmost hearts. Change is only superficial and apparent. \n\nFor too long we have been governed by reformers when we should have been led by preservers. Preservers of empire. Preservers of culture. Preservers of civilization. I care only for our Civilization and shall do all that is in my power to defend it."
newengland.121.a:0 "I AM PROVIDENCE"

newengland.122.t:0 "Dealing with Jim Curley"
newengland.122.d:0 "The oldest and strongest emotion of mankind is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear is fear of the unknown... They came for him in the night. In the morning, there was no trace left of Governor James Curley. The same fate had befallen many of his leading compatriots in Boston. Providence issued no statements on the matter. He only sent new administrators to occupy the positions vacated by the disappeared."
newengland.122.a:0 "Alas, poor Curley..."

newengland.123.t:0 "The Irish Question"
newengland.123.d:0 "The Celt has long been a thorn in the side of New England. He and his Catholic brethren from French Canada are alien impositions which disrupt the Anglo-Saxon purity of our great country. And now they risk political destabilization. We could encourage them to return to the Eire from whence they came with a swift boot and a muzzle. Or at least New York...\n\nBut it is also true that people who belong to the Teutonic and Celtic races are capable of assimilation to our English type and of becoming valuable acquisitions to the population. Many of the staunchest enemies of syndicalism in New England are of Irish extraction, even if they are bootleggers and scoundrels. We could use men like Kennedy and Coughlin to give the Irish a righteous purpose: defeating the treacherous red menace."
newengland.123.a:0 "Back to the Isle with you!"
newengland.123.b:0 "Arise, Christian Front!"

newengland.124.t:0 "Lovecraft's Speech"
newengland.124.d:0 "Heritage is everything. Without our nation we are merely wretched nuclei of agony and bewilderment in the midst of alien and directionless emptiness. We have a Teutonic-Celtic heritage, an Anglo-Saxon heritage, an Anglo-American heritage... An America without England is absolutely meaningless. The breaking of the saving tie has left these colonies free to build up a repulsive new culture of money, speed, quantity, novelty, and industrial slavery, but this culture is not ours. To say all this has anything to do with us is a joke! It must be our abiding mission to keep our culture alive as long as we can—and to preserve and defend it against the onslaughts of the Enemy."
newengland.124.a:0 "A new destiny!"

newengland.125.t:0 "Ministry of Culture and Tradition"
newengland.125.d:0 "Curricula are rewritten. Publishing houses are occupied. Even theatres are busted up by Lovecraftian fanatics. At this very moment, Providence’s most loyal supporters have entered the halls of higher learning to remove syndicalist and foreign influences from course-plans and develop a healthy, patriotic education plan for the nation's children. All newspapers, films, stage-plays, and books shall now be approved by the Ministry of Culture and Tradition, headed by the august Mr. Derleth. New England will no longer be polluted by the noisome, synthetic, and alien cultural winds of New York and Los Angeles."
newengland.125.a:0 "Make it so."

newengland.126.t:0 "The Arkham Mining Initiative"
newengland.126.d:0 "So much has happened in so short a time. Providence needed a place to clear his head and get away from the chaos of Boston and Hartford. He spent the last few nights in the Witch House, the home of the Honorable Jonathan Corwin, the eldest of Salem's structures, seeking inspiration in its ancient timbers. Upon his return, he delivered detailed instructions for an ambitious and heretofore unheard of plan to delve deep into the hills of Maine and Vermont; an industrial mining expedition to make New England more self-sufficient. Some in the government thought it foolhardy and ill-advised, but rich seams of ore were discovered!"
newengland.126.a:0 "Naturally."

newengland.127.t:0 "Lovecraft Dead!"
newengland.127.d:0 "Tragedy. Calamity. Across the nation, citizens mourn the passing of the greatest American since the founding of the Republic. Providence guided us for years; a steady hand on the tiller of state in a time when war and chaos engulfed not only our country, but the world. Lovecraft died in the early hours of the morning, following a long and secretive battle with intestinal cancer. While state histories will report that he died while tirelessly at work in his office, never giving in until the end, most of the day-to-day matters of state had already passed to stalwarts such as Derleth and Barlow.  Writers, fans, and patriots flocked to his home after the announcement, and a national day of mourning is in effect. Whether you believed he was a prophet or a monster, Lovecraft’s influence on New England and America will be felt for years to come."
newengland.127.a:0 "For me it is Elysium..."

newengland.128.t:0 "Lovecraft's Successor"
newengland.128.d:0 "The apparatus of government left behind by Lovecraft was constructed in such a way that all of its bureaucratic gears and administrative pistons revolved around a single person. Who could possibly master this engine of statecraft like Providence? Earn the loyalty of its legions? See the patterns in its anarchic machinations? The two natural choices are both old confidants of Lovecraft. The fanatic, August Derleth, and the more esoteric members of the government known as the 'Lovecraft Circle,' or the writer and diplomat, Frank Belknap Long, to whom Lovecraft was a mentor before his explosive entrance into politics. Lacking children or a succession plan, only Craterus can decide."
newengland.128.a:0 "Derleth and the Circle."
newengland.128.b:0 "Long and Adventure."

newengland.129.t:0 "One Mr. Kennedy..."
newengland.129.d:0 "Providence has made the decision to tolerate the Celtic Papists, so they should be put to good use. Those inspired by Coughlin in the Christian Front are a good start, but the Priest has thrown in his lot with the Union State. We require another to be a good influence on the mind of the Irishman. Curley is out, but there remains another giant in the hyphenate community... \n\nJoseph Patrick Kennedy. A shameless womanizer, bootlegger, stock speculator, and venal politician to boot. However, his money and influence would be no small help in unifying New England around Providence. Yes, they could be commandeered. But if rumors are true, Kennedy shares the Loyal Coalition’s suspicions, both of democracy and of certain powers corrupting the nation from New York and Los Angeles. Summon to him to Rhode Island."
newengland.129.a:0 "Let's make a deal."

newengland.130.t:0 "The Young Kennedy"
newengland.130.d:0 "Our arrangement with Kennedy has born interesting fruit. The eldest of his sons, a young man for whom the father holds presidential ambitions, has fit nicely into the new order. Joseph Kennedy Jr. has also led other well-to-do Sons of New England to join Providence's camarilla. The young Kennedy has adapted well to Lovecraft's New England, not only because of his fascination with Lovecraft's literary work, but in his astute observations of the world today. During a visit of the Old World, he expressed his admiration for Codreanu 'building a spirit in his men that could be envied in any country,' and has praised eugenic programs espoused by the Silver Legion. Better still is the young man's courageous devotion to the cause. It might be yet another political angle by his crafty father, but 'Jr.' always seems to volunteer for the most dangerous posts... There is one troublesome thing, however. Joseph and his friends have become involved with one of Derleth's odd little clubs. While fraternal societies are a main-stay of New England's pseudo-aristocrats, Providence cannot publicly approve of occult parlor games and secretive fraternities."
newengland.130.a:0 "He shows great promise."

newengland.131.t:0 "The Golden Age of Comics"
newengland.131.d:0 "Providence may have been an influential author, but his elusive lifestyle meant he was not as prolific or connected to publishing community as his friend, the Minister of Culture, August Derleth. His experience and friendships in this arena have allowed Derleth to expand publishing for state-sponsored artists and writers, focusing on tales for children. Not only does this give out-of-work creatives a new form of employment, but it ensures young minds are molded by Lovecraft-approved influences. New favorites include Doctor Fate, the Cosmic Sorcerer-Scientist, and Conan the Barbarian, a creation of another member of the Lovecraft Circle, Robert E. Howard."
newengland.131.a:0 "Wham! Kapow! Eat your vegetables!"

newengland.132.t:0 "The Restoration of Democracy"
newengland.132.d:0 "Leslie Groves has announced that the military government of New England will be stepping down and snap elections will be held... again. Perhaps desiring a return to normalcy and stability, New Englanders elected the same man they had chosen in the snap elections that started all of this business, Joseph William Martin Jr. May he have better luck forming a government this time than he did when figures like the Lovecraftians and Quakers were still around."
newengland.132.a:0 "Good luck!"

newengland.133.t:0 "The Ambush at Red Hook"
newengland.133.d:0 "Our men are in position. In concert with some sympathetic minds among the Norwegian immigrant community at Red Hook, we have established a beachhead in New York City that will allow us to take the city from the Syndicalists before they even know the attack has begun. Soldiers will be ferried ashore under cover of darkness and penetrate the outer perimeter of the red defenses. All we await is your go ahead to spring the trap, o Providence."
newengland.133.a:0 "Traps are gay."

newengland.134.t:0 "Democratic Charges of Anti-Semitism"
newengland.134.d:0 "As if Curley was not enough, now the Democratic governor of New York, Herbert H. Lehman, has announced his opposition to Providence, declaring him a racialist, an anti-semite, and un-American. As a reform Jew, Lehman's actions are nakedly self-interested, but he still wields considerable influence throughout New England's industrial heartland in upstate New York. If only that accursed Lehman had gone to his fellow Syndicalists in Manhattan instead of remaining in Albany... We can brook no more dissent from these 'Democrats.' \n\n Providence is an anti-Semitic by nature, but thought he had concealed his prejudice in his remarks concerning the future of New England and its fight against subversive elements. He showed opportunists and idlers like Lehman every consideration, carefully saying that he attacked Syndicalism and foreign influence, not religion. However, if Jerusalem wishes to start trouble, he will find in Providence a new Titus, eager to inscribe on his eagles the triumphant legend IVDAEA CAPTA!"
newengland.134.a:0 "IVDEA CAPTA"

newengland.135.t:0 "New English Spirit"
newengland.135.d:0 "Everything I love has been dead for two centuries—or, as in the case of Graeco-Roman classicism, for two milenniums. But that is not dead which can eternal lie, to one day rise and live again. I say to you, New England, that here we can build anew the Roman Republic which our forebears sought to resurrect! Here we can revive the Teutonic spirit! Here we will light a flame that the ages shall not extinguish! New England lives!"
newengland.135.a:0 "And marches on!"

newengland.136.t:0 "Lovecraft Visits Schools"
newengland.136.d:0 "Today, Providence visited a classroom in Hartford to speak to a group of primary school children about the values of good living and proper conduct.\n\n 'You should follow the ancient, simple New England ways of living, and observe the principles of honour expected of a descendant of English gentlemen. It is pride and beauty and the automatic instincts of generations trained in certain conduct, which determine my own actions from day to day, as it should do for you. For example, you should never cheat or steal. Also, never wear a top-hat with a sack coat or munch bananas in public on the streets, because a gentleman does not do those things either...'"
newengland.136.a:0 "He went on like this for some time."

newengland.137.t:0 "Providence Addresses the Troops"
newengland.137.d:0 "Nothing must disturb your undiluted Englishry! You are Nordics! — chalk-white, bulky Teutons of the Scandinavian or North-German forests — Vikinga berserk killers — the predatory rovers of Hengist and Horsa — conquerors of Celts and mongrels and founders of Empires — sons of the thunders and the arctic winds, and brothers to the frosts and the auroras — drinkers of foemen's blood from new picked skulls — friends of the mountain buzzards and feeders of seacoast vultures — comrades of the wolves, and riders of nightmares. A prayer to Odin and Thor and Woden and Alfadur, the raucous shouter of Niffelheim. God save the King!"
newengland.137.a:0 "God save New England!"

newengland.138.t:0 "Lovecraft Denounces Democracy"
newengland.138.d:0 "Of what use is it to please the herd? They are simply coarse animals — all that is admirable in man is the artificial product of special breeding. We advocate the preservation of conditions favourable to the growth of beautiful things and a physically select human type such as only luxury and a pure racial strain can produce. Thus we oppose democracy, if only because it would retard the development of the Nordic breed. We realise that all conceptions of justice and ethics are mere prejudices and illusions. “Equality” is a joke! A great abbey or cathedral, covered with moss, is a poignant reality. It is for us to safeguard and preserve the conditions which produce great abbeys, and palaces, and picturesque walled town, and vivid sky-lines of steeples and domes, and luxurious tapestries, and fascinating books, paintings and statuary, and colossal organs and noble music, and dramatic deeds on embattled fields — these are all there is of life. \n\nTake them away and our poets have nothing to sing — our dreamers have nothing to dream about. The blood of a million men is well shed in producing one glorious legend which thrills posterity. We come from people who faced tremendous odds again and again. Much is against you, but you have within you that will, that Teutonic spirit which will lead the generations to come to look back at you through the pages of history and say, to New England, to America, to Civilisation, they were true."
newengland.138.a:0 "Will the Republicans finally shut up..."

newengland.139.t:0 "Lovecraft Justifies Irish Exclusion"
newengland.139.d:0 "Naturally we believe in our own race. Any man worth anything believes in his own race as he believes in his own family. It doesn't mean you want to injure other races or other families or think yourself superior. No anthropologist of standing insists on the uniformly advanced evolution of the Nordic as compared with that of other Caucasian and Mongolian races. I freely concede that the Mediterranean race turns out a higher percentage of the aesthetically sensitive and that the Semitic groups excel in sharp, precise intellectation. It may be, too, that the Mongolian excels in aesthetick capacity and normality of philosophical adjustment. What, then, is the secret of pro-Nordicism among those who hold these views? Simply this—that ours is a Nordic culture, and that the roots of that culture are so inextricably tangled in the national standards, perspectives, traditions, memories, instincts, peculiarities, and physical aspects of the Nordic stream that no other influences are fitted to mingle in our fabric. We don't despise the French in France or Quebec, but we don't want them grabbing our territory and creating foreign islands like Woonsocket and Fall River!"
newengland.139.a:0 "And the same for the Sinn Fein!"

newengland.140.t:0 "Miskatonic Expeditions"
newengland.140.d:0 "Providence spent the previous three days in isolation from his cabinet. Upon return, he announced plans to fund expeditions of archaeologists and anthropolists from Harvard, Yale, and Mistkatonic University. The targets of these expeditions will be supposed sites of ancient ruins in northern Africa, the Far-East, and South America. While many of the locations Providence identified are not thought to contain any evidence of ancient civilizations, it's possible he was inspired by Hiram Bingham's recent discovery of Machu Picchu?"
newengland.140.a:0 "Providence's wish is our command."


newengland.161.t:0 "An Armistice Thanksgiving"
newengland.161.d:0 "Clarence Pickett has arrived upon a novel idea. Americans are at war because they think they have nothing in common and do not try to understand each other. We must emphasize the traditions that bind us together. He has sent invitations to the leaders of the major belligerent factions of the Second American Civil War for a good, old-fashioned, New England feast of Thanksgiving. We should be able to talk out our issues, not kill each other!\n\n Sadly, most of his invitations went unanswered."
newengland.161.a:0 "But William Dudley Pelley came!"

newengland.162.t:0 "New England Delicacies"
newengland.162.d:0 "Governor Wilbur Cross of Connecticut has made a point of popularizing various Yankee dishes as a means of differentiating the New English identity from the greater American nation in the midst of the second civil war. Clam chowder, Boston baked beans, and johnnycakes to name a few. Most popular, however, is a curious meal originating out of a restaurant called Jack's Lunch in Middletown, Connecticut. Known as 'steamed hams,' the recipe calls for hamburgers, layered in cheddar cheese, steamed in a tray to preserve moisture. They grew in popularity amongst New England's political elite during the Second Hartford Convention after a roast prepared for the states' leaders was ruined. An entrepreneurial mission by the restaurant's owner to sate the appeties of New England's finest saved the day!"
newengland.162.a:0 "An unforgettable luncheon."

newengland.163.t:0 "Our Own America 2.0"
newengland.163.d:0 "Our southern ally, our 'New' England has accomplished the impossible. They have entered the fray of the American Civil War and emerged victorious. We, too, claimed some territory from the broken United States. Should we hand this land over to the Yankees of New England or keep it for ourselves?"
newengland.163.a:0 "Yes, of course!"

newengland.200.d:0 "The greater part of America is a ruined hellscape, torn apart by war and savage bands of extremists, each clawing at the other's throats for power to subjugate and enslave their enemies. There is no steady hand of state; no wise ruler or aristocratic nobility to guide the spirit of America, nor a rational economist to recover it from the depths of economic depression. Only thieves and liars remain. We New Englanders cannot sit by and watch our great country extinguish itself in internecine conflict. Providence will not allow it!"
newengland.200.a:0 "O Hail Columbia!"

newengland.201.t:0 "The Red Menace"
newengland.201.d:0 "A sensible planned system could have been used to uplift the Teutonic Spirit of the American people. Instead, the Syndicalists went the way of the bandit; killing and thieving from those they deemed unworthy of the property they owned. And to make matters worse, allying themselves with the worst elements in American society in a conspiracy to undermine the Anglo-Saxon people who built this country! Now they stew in Chicago and Detroit, tearing down the great edifices of man and erecting altars to their Satanic struggle. Theirs is an ideology of envy; not fairness. And we shall crush it with extreme prejudice. For Providence! For America!"
newengland.201.a:0 "The only good Red is a dead Red."

newengland.202.t:0 "The Southern Expedition"
newengland.202.d:0 "It is a shame it has come to this. Providence admires many who live and fight for the Union State. Many of them are kindred spirits with the Loyal Coalition. But their leaders are charlatans. A disreputable politician who plans to fill the cabinet with family members. A deranged, religious fanatic with a foolish hatred of scientific progress. And a coterie of corrupt businessmen waiting in the wings. These are the saviors of America? These are the guardians of the nation's Teutonic spirit? If that's the case, then it is our duty to save America from itself. Providence wills it!"
newengland.202.a:0 "Down with the traitors!"

newengland.203.t:0 "The Decadent West"
newengland.203.d:0 "Was there any revolution more needless and contrived than that of the Pacific Governors? Could it be more obvious that all they wanted was power and control for themselves? What were they rebelling against? They profess to represent that sclerotic ideology known as 'democracy.' Was their unilateral declaration of independence any more democratic than MacArthur's coup? Were the Mormons of Utah or the cowboys of Texas consulted about being ruled from Sacramento and Hollywood? The nerve of these upjumped plutocrats and culture-changers... Providence demands the conquest of California."

newengland.204.t:0 "The Old Order"
newengland.204.d:0 "Washington is where it all started. A wretched hive of scum and villainy whence issues nothing save taxes and excuses. A gaping maw swallowing any man of talent, loyalty, and duty that is foolish enough to step foot in the capital. These stuffed suits argued and dithered and did nothing while the country fell into anarchy. They're a gaggle of Neros playing the fiddle as Rome burns. A nation divided against itself cannot stand. Is there a greater source of division than the 'democratic experiment' practiced each day in Washington? And the camorra of generals and plutocrats filling its halls? This government shall not stand!"

newengland.205.d:0 "What shall come of the blasted remains of old America, the Fallen States? War came like a cleansing fire to clear out the brush of this continent; to remind the descendants of those who founded this grand Columbian republic of their destiny. All of the arrogant and arbitrary extremes of American political life have been silenced, and in the battle royal of America's Second Civil War, one man stands triumphant. Providence. What grand, terrifying dreams he has. Sun-drenched glimpses of magic and splendor. Wondrous marble-gold cities built on the ruins of crawling chaos that came before. And damn those who would stand in his way."
newengland.205.a:0 "A fire shall be woken..."

newengland.206.t:0 "What about Howard?"
newengland.206.d:0 "Providence never knew what became of R.E. Howard once the war started. Prior to the conflict, Lovecraft had sent his good friend some money to help pay for the treatment of his ailing mother, and he had heard that Howard was considered for a position in the Union State government. It is only now with the guns cold and the swords sheathed that Lovecraft learns his friend had taken his own life following the death of his mother to Tuberculosis. Derleth has assured Providence that Howard's tales of heroic action will be incorporated into the syllabi of every grade school in the nation."

newengland.208.d:0 "Providence has long looked with favor on the Ku-Klux-Klan, that noble but much maligned band of Southerners who saved half of our country from destruction at the close of the First Civil War. Close historical study of the Klu-Klux-Klan finds nothing but Honour, Chivalry, and Patriotism in the activities of the Invisible Empire. The Klan merely did for the people what the law refused to do, removing the ballot from unfit hands and restoring to the victims of political vindictiveness their natural rights. The alleged lawbreaking of the Klan was committed only by irresponsible miscreants who, after the dissolution of the Order by its Grand Wizard, Gen. Nathan Bedford Forrest, used its weird masks and terrifying costumes to veil their unorganised villainies.\n\nMany of the Union State’s most courageous defenders were members of the Klan; foolishly suppressed by the Syndicalist-sympathizer, Huey Long. Providence is considering making common cause with them and other ultra-rightist elements of the old Union government in an attempt to pacify the rebellious South. Recruit them into the new government, rehabilitate their image, and half the country will be docile within the month!"
newengland.208.a:0 "Yes, they're useful."
newengland.208.b:0 "No, they're trouble."

newengland.209.t:0 "Lovecraftian Economics"
newengland.209.d:0 "To survive in the 20th century, America must develop a sensible economic policy. This will be a bulwark against Syndicalism, which brings with any rational economic planning a devilish desire to destroy the culture-tradition of any nation it infects. But of course the real need of change comes not from the mere fact of abundant resources or rebellious reds, but from the growth of conditions making it impossible for millions to have any chance of getting any resources under the present outworn set of artificial rules. This development is no myth. Machines had displaced 900,000 men in the United States before the Black Monday of '36, and no conceivable regime of “prosperity” (where by a few people will have abundant and flexible resources and successfully exchange them among one another) will ever make it possible to avoid the permanent presence of millions of unemployed, so long as old-fashioned laissez-faire capitalism is adhered to. Shall we allow antique notions of allocation— “property,” etc.—to interfere with the rational distribution of this abundant stock of resources among all those who require them? What reasonable objection is there to an intelligent centralised control of resources whose primary object shall be the elimination of want in every quarter—a thing possible without removing comfortable living from any one now enjoying it?"
newengland.209.a:0 "This sounds like Maximism!"

newengland.210.t:0 "A New Recruit"
newengland.210.d:0 "A young man has been put forward to Providence as a potential member of the new American government. Despite his young age, the man is a well-known zealot for ultra-rightist causes. His work was published by Father Coughlin when he was still in university. During the civil war, he made connections with the Silver Shirts, Codreanu’s Legion, and Savinkovist elements in Russia. This Francis Yockey also humbly submits himself to Providence as a useful soldier in the fight for America, if he would have him."
newengland.210.a:0 "Another member of the Lovecraft Circle."
newengland.210.b:0 "We have enough young writers, I think."

newengland.211.t:0 "Hoover Comes Up for Air"
newengland.211.d:0 "J. Edgar Hoover, the erstwhile director of the FBI has reappeared following the civil war. Apparently he managed to avoid detection or assassination during the various reprisals during the latter stages of the war. A staunch enemy of syndicalism and gangsterism, Hoover humbly lays himself at the mercy of Providence. Some of Lovecraft's advisors note that Hoover as a MacArthurite and ambitious power-grabber, known for wielding the FBI as a personal army of blackmailers and assassins. Others argue that his experience and ruthlessness will be well-used in the years to come."
newengland.211.a:0 "Welcome back, Hoover."
newengland.211.b:0 "He's too much trouble."

newengland.212.t:0 "Amnesty Pays Off"
newengland.212.d:0 "Many of the America First members whom Providence pardoned after the end of the civil war have become Lovecraft's stalwart defenders in the South (even though the more religious of them have suspicions of his atheist sensibilities). In their local communities, they emphasize that Lovecraft is the first American president to face the threats of automation, immigration, and syndicalization head on. Senators Coleman Blease and John Rankin are particular supporters of Lovecraft in the nascent Congress."
newengland.212.a:0 "Mercy has its benefits, I suppose."

newengland.213.t:0 "Diego Rivera Found"
newengland.213.d:0 "The syndicalist artist and vandal, Diego Rivera, was finally caught while attempting to cross the border back into Mexico. Infamous for his destruction of Nelson Rockefeller's art collection, as well as the proliferation of numerous heinous pieces of degenerate 'popular' art throughout the north under the tenure of the Combined Syndicates, he has been on the run ever since the fall of the Reed regime in Chicago. Lovecraft tasked the Providence Guard with tracking down the foreign cretin, intent on catching that so-called 'artist' so jealous of the works in Rockefeller's collection he saw fit to ruin them. Rivera was brought back to New York where he was executed for Crimes Against Art & Beauty."
newengland.213.a:0 "Justice is served."

newengland.214.t:0 "The Hollywood Problem"
newengland.214.d:0 "While New York City and Chicago have been pacified, Hollywood remains a problem for Providence. Yet another bastion of syndicalist influence, it is especially dangerous because of its influence on wider American culture. Unfortunately, it's a far greater task for the Ministry of Culture to review every film coming out of Los Angeles than it was to review every play in New England. Some of the Providence Guard are partial to burning Hollywood to the ground and salting the earth as a message to anyone else that might seek to undermine America's culture-tradition in the future. Representative Martin Dies of Texas and Senator Owen Brewster of Maine have suggested reviving Nance Garner's proposal that a committee be established to investigate actors, directors, and screenwriters working in Hollywood with ties to international syndicalism. Already on the list to be subpoenaed are screenwriters such as Herbert Biberman and Lester Cole."
newengland.214.a:0 "Hollywood delenda est."
newengland.214.b:0 "Establish the HUAC."

newengland.215.t:0 "The Hunt in New York"
newengland.215.d:0 "At the start of the war, New York City was bombed with impunity. Providence considered the city long lost to the degenerate, foreign influence of asiatics and semites. The wretched, Hunnic city of New York, where people lived on top of one another, where the streets stunk of refuse and human waste, could only be improved by annihilation. New York City was plunged into an abyss of purging fire and retaliatory violence by Anglo-Saxon soldiers. And the campaign continued until the Combined Syndicates were destroyed. But it was not, as some had predicted, the end of American syndicalism. Instead, Lovecraft's apocalypse was only the prologue of another bloody chapter in American history. Delta Green assures Providence that even now, surviving syndicalists plot and scheme to tear apart America from within."
newengland.215.a:0 "Martial Law in Manhattan!"

newengland.216.t:0 "Charles Coughlin in Lovecraft's America"
newengland.216.d:0 "The wisdom of Providence knows no bounds. When at first he chose to work with the most zealous, Catholic Celts in Boston, many of his supporters were confused, for his hatred of the Sinn Fein rebels of the Emerald Isle was well known. Yet, the Christian Front proved themselves ardent prosecutors of Lovecraft's will in the decadent cities of the northeast. Charles Coughlin, the man who inspired the Christian Front to action, sided with Huey Long's Union State in the civil war, but since the reconstitution of the United States, he has been yet another voice promulgating Lovecraft's message across America. The Ministry of Culture now sponsors Coughlin's radio show and his magazine, Social Justice. While Providence could not care less about Coughlin's religious views, he is happy to support his crusade against the 'anti-American forces of Red Revolution.'"
newengland.216.a:0 "He is all-seeing!"

newengland.217.t:0 "The Hollywood List"
newengland.217.d:0 "Hollywood has always acted above the law. It's mere existence in California was an attempt to dodge intellectual property laws. Moreover, it is no secret that some artists there had hoped for a syndicalist victory over our great American Republic. The noble members of the House Un-American Activities Committee have, through interviews and testimony, put together a list of the crypto-socialists and 'syndie' sympathizers that continue to work in Los Angeles. Their folly must be exposed and their sedition prosecuted."
newengland.217.a:0 "We'll film their trials."

newengland.218.t:0 "NAACP declares the government Illegitimate"
newengland.218.d:0 "In the wake of the devastating civil war, the future of African-American rights fought so long for is again threatened. Long gone is Huey Long, who promised protection, or the Combined Syndicates, which promised liberation. With Long, the CSA, and even the old federal government gone, all illusions of safety are dead. Lovecraft has made his opinion of the 'negro' quite clear and endorses the imposition and maintenance of a Colour Line, but he assures the NAACP that he disapproves of deliberate cruelty towards African-Americans in the same way he disapproves of cruelty towards oxen, dogs, or poultry. Walter Francis White, along with several high ranking members of the NAACP, have declared the new America illegitimate. Many of them now prepare to emigrate to Canada and other countries as Marcus Garvey and so many others did during slavery."
newengland.218.a:0 "Providence declares the NAACP subhuman."

newengland.219.t:0 "Southerners Suggest Pass Laws"
newengland.219.d:0 "Some of the more radical members of the southern Long government with whom Providence reconciled have suggested issuing passbooks to African-Americans throughout the United States and enacting a 'Pass Law' to control their movement. This law is similar to older internal passport used during the time of the Confederacy to identify freemen and slaves. This would result in numerous African-Americans being forbidden from traveling outside of the south with plans to extend zoning into the rest of the country. Some members of the government argue this will help enforce Lovecraft's 'Colour Line' while the moderates see believe this will be an unnecessary provocation of African-Americans and liberal-minded people. Lovecraft's advisors note that such a law would fuel the fires of accusations that he is a racialist. Providence seemed undaunted, replying, 'race prejudice is a gift of Nature, intended to preserve in purity the various divisions of mankind which the ages have evolved."
newengland.219.a:0 "Papers Please."

newengland.220.t:0 "The Third Great Migration"
newengland.220.d:0 "Those thousands of African-Americans that left America before the civil war are being joined by hundreds of thousands more fleeing Lovecraft's terror. Groups like the International Labor Defence and the NAACP are now working together with the Red Cross to evacuate masses of people struggling to remain free. In Providence's opinion, the fewer the dissidents and degenerates internally, the safer loyal Americans can sleep. The question is: what shall we do? Shall we let them leave, or shall we keep them here?"
newengland.220.a:0 "America is expelling toxins."
newengland.220.b:0 "I've changed my mind. Stop them."

newengland.221.t:0 "American Refugees arrive"
newengland.221.d.liberia:0 "The thousands that arrived with Marcus Garvey in the early 1930s anticipated that more refugees would come. Even the strongest pessimist could not anticipate the overflow of refugees the Black Star Line has picked up and dropped off in Monrovia. Families are reunited, and the Grain Coast now swells with thousands more Americo Liberians. Those more concerned with food production however have noted that we can't really handle a growing population at this time."
newengland.221.d.mexico:0 "The existence of American refugees in Mexico has generally been ignored by the Central Government, as we have had amicable relations with America in the past. However, this Providence is a threat to the entire continent, and the thousands more refugees crossing the Rio Grande tell of the Lovecraft's horrors. These refugees are far different from the Ambrose Bierce's' looking to retire, they are scarred and determined to end the Lovecraftian regime of America."
newengland.221.d.haiti:0 "Haiti has always portrayed themselves as the second home for African-Americans. A common story to tell was that the first Haitian was a refugee of Ethiopia that ran with such force that he only stopped when he fell into Haiti. Now we see this again coming out of the USA. The sinister Lovecraft should not have the right to do this to American people! We feel the refugees' outrage, at the same time we struggle to determine whether our fragile economy can handle a labor surplus of this magnitude."
newengland.221.d.cuba:0 "Just a 300 mile boat trip separated the thousands of American refugees from Cuba. Families in Cuba have been calling for months to their families to escape the very real threat of a nationalist takeover. None of them anticipated that the bottleneck in Florida would be opened all at once, causing hundreds of boats to show up at Varadero today. The flood of refugees from America has clogged up our ports, tied up or landlines, and put strain on the government ministry to respond. What should be our answer?"
newengland.221.d.hawaii:0 "An incredible amount of the Pacific separated us from the carnage in America, as well as the hand of that monster Lovecraft. We can only keep such good tabs on the so-called Commonwealth because trade with them is good, and now those trading ships have stowaways. These arrivals tell tales of burning towns and rampant pillaging by the Ku Klux Klan that forced them to evacuate the continent to Hawaii. We may have issues handling the immigration process from a legal standpoint as well, so we must decide the fate of these American passengers."
newengland.221.a:0 "You are welcome to stay."
newengland.221.b:0 "We do not want you."

newengland.222.t:0 "The Red Scare"
newengland.222.d:0 "Since Lovecraft has taken power he has begun a campaign against socialism, anarchism, and syndicalism. Though never pushed by Providence himself, writers, publishers, and critics connected to the Lovecraft Circle are pushing the theory that the secretive doomsday cults seen in Lovecraft's writings were actually veiled allusion (or prophetic predictions...) of the world-wide socialist menace. Socialism was, after all, the main instigator of the civil war. As such all Americans must know the role that its supporters played in the conflict. As the so-called 'red scare' begins many are being forced out of jobs and blacklisted."
newengland.222.a:0 "Better Dead than Red."

newengland.223.t:0 "Lavender Scare"
newengland.223.d:0 "With the so-called Red Scare underway, Lovecraft has issued Executive Order 10450 that broadened the definition of a national security risk to include 'Any criminal, infamous, dishonest, immoral, or notoriously disgraceful conduct, habitual use of intoxicants to excess, drug addiction, or sexual perversion.' In truth, this simply made official the strict standards the Providence Guard had exacted in New England. This has led to the firing of over 5,000 federal employees who were accused of being homosexual. The press have mostly approved of this measure, although a few tabloids claim we are preaching hypocracy. One of Lovecraft's closest confidantes, R.H. Barlow, has suffered under accusations of homosexuality. Providence himself, with his large coterie of young writers enamored with his work, has had to quash nefarious suggestions, as well. The rumors are universally false, but tabloids love these wicked stories. Perhaps they require a visit from the Ministry of Culture..."
newengland.223.a:0 "Send some agents."

newengland.224.t:0 "American Architecture"
newengland.224.d:0 "For most of the 1920s and 1930s the Art Deco art style was the dominant style of architecture and from coast to coast buildings were built in the Art Deco style. However, when the Combined Syndicates ruled the north, they vandalized and destroyed many of these architectural beauties, and the civil war ruined many more. The centers of many American cities are still blasted ruins. This vacuum creates opportunity. Some of the leading economic theorists influencing Providence have suggested the new, utilitarian architectural style of Modernism, mostly seen in France and Italy. The most traditional members of the Lovecraft Circle have come out in force to counter that Art Deco is 'the' American style, dominating the skyline of New York City. Diego Rivera's demolition of the Rockefeller Center artwork, chiseling the faces of Marx and Lenin over Zeus and Thor was an outrageous crime against America's culture-tradition. Derleth, however, rejects both options; instead arguing that America's cities be rebuilt in the Neo-Classical, Beaux-Arts style which impressed so many in the White City of the World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago. Which style shall be supported?"
newengland.224.a:0 "Preserve Art Deco."
newengland.224.b:0 "Modernism."
newengland.224.c:0 "Neo-Classical Revival!"

newengland.225.t:0 "Trial of the Weapons companies"
newengland.225.d:0 "A number of Weapons companies have fought for the various traitors and rebels against America. Providence will decide their fate. Shall we allow them to operate again, or shall they be regarded as traitors and be treated as such?"
newengland.225.a:0 "Allow them to operate again."
newengland.225.b:0 "They are traitors and should be treated as such."

newengland.226.t:0 "Trial of the Heavy Equipment companies"
newengland.226.d:0 "A number of Heavy Equipment companies have fought for the various traitors and rebels against America. Providence will decide their fate. Shall we allow them to operate again, or shall they be regarded as traitors and be treated as such?"
newengland.226.a:0 "Allow them to operate again."
newengland.226.b:0 "They are traitors and should be treated as such."

newengland.227.t:0 "Trial of the Aviation companies"
newengland.227.d:0 "A number of Aviation companies have fought for the various traitors and rebels against America. Providence will decide their fate. Shall we allow them to operate again, or shall they be regarded as traitors and be treated as such?"
newengland.227.a:0 "Allow them to operate again."
newengland.227.b:0 "They are traitors and should be treated as such."

newengland.228.t:0 "Trial of the Naval companies"
newengland.228.d:0 "A number of Naval companies have fought for the various traitors and rebels against America. Providence will decide their fate. Shall we allow them to operate again, or shall they be regarded as traitors and be treated as such?"
newengland.228.a:0 "Allow them to operate again."
newengland.228.b:0 "They are traitors and should be treated as such."

newengland.229.t:0 "Trial of the Industrial companies"
newengland.229.d:0 "A number of Industrial companies have fought for the various traitors and rebels against America. Providence will decide their fate. Shall we allow them to operate again, or shall they be regarded as traitors and be treated as such?"
newengland.229.a:0 "Allow them to operate again."
newengland.229.b:0 "They are traitors and should be treated as such."

newengland.230.t:0 "Unions in Lovecraft's America"
newengland.230.d:0 "With the civil war over and reconstruction now underway, the question of trade unions has arisen. Most of Lovecraft's supporters are fiercely anti-union, seeing the unions as hotbeds for traitors and disseminators of Syndicalism. However, Providence and his close friend Frank B. Long are not-so-secret admirers of Oswald Mosley's Maximist economics. Perhaps the unions could be put to good use, if controlled by the state. Some think that we should promote more liberal and anti-syndicalist unions to be a ward against the influence of Syndicalism in politics. A few loyalists within the AFL and the defunct Knights of Labor are willing to cooperate with Providence in creating a national labor relations board. This board would be manned by Lovecraftians and could isolate those affiliated with the IWW. Others, however, believe all trade unions should be outlawed toggether. Providence has decided to...?"
newengland.230.a:0 "Accept the AFL and KoL into the NLRB."
newengland.230.b:0 "Outlaw all Unions regardless of loyalty."

newengland.231.t:0 "The Flag of Lovecraft's America"
newengland.231.d:0 "Now that the United States have been united under the guiding hand of Providence, there is some debate over whether a new flag ought to be unveiled for the country. Many of Lovecraft's loyalists see the flag of the old Fallen States as an object of wickedness and the fall of America. We could continue to use Lovecraft's personal sigil, the Elder Sign on a sanguine field. Others suggest mixing the Elder Sign with the flag of the Fallen States, to symbolize the nation's revival under Lovecraft's protection."
newengland.231.a:0 "The Yankee Elder Sign"
newengland.231.b:0 "A new, American Elder Sign. (Circle)"
newengland.231.c:0 "A new, American Elder Sign. (Shield)"

###############################################

NEE_LESLIE_GROVES_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 17, 1896, in Albany, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Leslie Richard Groves Jr. was born in a family with quite a history in the military, considering his father had served in the Spanish-American War, the Philippines and the Boxer Rebellion. During his late high-school years, Groves started to enroll in courses at the University of Washington, hoping to get an appointment to the United States Military Academy. He got his wish when President Woodrow Wilson himself allowed him to compete for his vacancy, but his grades weren't high enough to be accepted. Instead, Groves joined the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in the meantime while he prepared to retake West Point's entrance exam. In 1916, he took the entrance exam again, and was accepted, visiting the European battlefields on an educational tour in 1919 and graduating in 1920 as a second lieutenant in the Corps of Engineers, thanks to his experience in MIT. He was posted with the 4th Engineer corps stationed at Camp Lewis, and would later be moved to Fort Worden, where he'd meet his future wife, Grace Wilson. In late 1922, he was posted in Hawaii with the 3rd Engineer corps at the Schofield Barracks, where he earned a commendation for helping construct a trail from Kahuku to Pupukea. He would be assigned several times, becoming commander of Company D of the 1st Engineer Battalion, helping during the New England flood of 1927, being sent to Nicaragua in 1929 to conduct surveys for the construction of the Nicaragua Canal, and he being assigned to look over Nicaragua's water supply after the 1931 earthquake. It was upon his return to a shattered United States that he gained his last promotions, rising to the rank of Field Marshall in New England, mainly due to the sheer lack of capable staff in the region.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- A brilliant engineer, he has been following closely the development of Nuclear Fission technology keeping regular contact with Otto Hahn and Lise Meitner."
NEE_MERRITT_A_EDSON_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W April 25, 1897, in Rutland, Vermont, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Merritt Austin Edson joined the University of Vermont in 1915, and in June 1916 he joined the First Infantry Regiment of the Vermont National Guard, where he was sent to Eagle Pass, Texas to work in the Mexican Border. He'd return to Vermont in September, but some time after returning to his university he signed up for the Marine Corps Reserve. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps on October 1917, and would be promoted to first lieutenant in June 1920. He later signed up for the Naval Air Station Pensacola, and earned his gold wings as a naval aviator in 1922. He was later stationed in Guam, where received training on semi-tropical environments and upon returning to the US in 1925, he'd take an advanced aviation tactics course at Kelly Field, Texas. He'd later be sent to Nicaragua to fight against the Sandinista forces, and would return to the United States by late 1929. He has since then become the Coach and captain of the Marine corps National Rifle and Pistol teams, managing to win both the 1935 and 1936 tournaments, despite several interruptions due to the growing social unrest. He was finally promoted to Major in February 1936, and assigned to Philadelphia. With the collapse of the Union into civil war, Merritt hardly managed to reach New England before the CSA's armies closed down the border towards New England. His experience and fame have granted him an early promotion to the rank of Brigadier General.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- Apathetic to politics."
NEE_MARK_CLARK_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W May 1, 1896, in Sackets Harbour, New York State, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Mark Wayne Clark was born into a family with a great military history. His grandfather was George Rogers Clark, a military general from the times of the American Revolution, and is the cousin of Army General George Marshall. He joined the United States Military Academy at West Point when he was just 17, in 1917, but unfortunately lost time in his career due to his constant illness. In his time in West Point, he met and befriended Dwight Eisenhower, and Clark graduated in April 1917 alongside Matthew Ridgway and J. Lawton Collins as a second lieutenant. Like his grandfather, he chose to serve in the Infantry corps where he was assigned to the 11th Infantry Regiment. He'd later serve in a variety of staff and training roles, gaining the rank of First Lieutenant in 1921, the rank of Captain in 1925 after completing the professional officer course at the US  Army Infantry School, and reached rank of Major in 1933 after being assigned as the training instructor of the Indiana Army National Guard. He served as the deputy commander of the Civilian Conservation Corps district in Omaha, Nebraska while doing courses at the U.S. Army Command and General Staff School where he would meet old classmates like Matthew Ridgway once more, as well as meeting Walter Bedell Smith and Geoffrey Keyes, with whom he had a cordial relationship. As the internal situation deteriorated, Clark was on leave in New York, and when hostilities broke out, he moved to New England looking for safety. With the lack of capable staff, Clark has been hastily promoted to Brigadier General, where he'll now have to oversee the creation of a new army.\n§YImportant Notes:§W- While his loyalty is unquestioned, his friendship with now enemy Generals have raised concerns that General Clark will be unable to do his duty when the time comes to face them openly on the battlefield."
NEE_GEORGE_KENNEY_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W August 6, 1889, in Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, Canada\n§YMilitary Career:§W George Churchill Kenney entered the  Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1907 where he followed a course in civil engineering. He never completed his studies, as his father abandoned his family and he was forced to work in order to sustain his family. He later enlisted as a flying cadet for the Aviation section of the US Signal Corps. He was commissioned as a first lieutenant in the 5th of November of 1917 and would wouldn't be promoted until 1921 after taking a course at the Air Service Engineering School of Dayton, Ohio. He became Air Service Inspector of the Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company. In 1926, Kenney became a student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, where he became increasingly interested in the combined used of the air force and the army to coordinate deadly attacks. In September 1932, Kenney entered the Army War College in Washington D.C. where he joined one of several committees studying Weltkrieg battles, where he became an expert on the Second Battle of the Masurian Lakes, and began working on what came to be known as the War Plan Orange. He was promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in March 1935, and was assigned to the Infantry School at Fort Benning, in Georgia. However, seeing the buildup to the civil war from the Longist South, Kenney was certain that hostilities were about to break out so he prepared an escape plane with a group of loyalists, and decided to escape northwards as soon as hostilities broke out. Despite all odds, the plane managed to reach New England unscathed, and Kenney has joined the New England General Staff to provide for their defense any way he cans."
NEE_WILLARD_G_WYMAN_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W March 21, 1898, in Augusta, Maine, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Willard Gordon Wyman entered the United States Military Academy in 1917 and was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the Coastal Artillery Branch, and later transferred to the Cavalry Branch of the United States Army. He became an infantry and cavalry instructor in 1921, and would gain valuable experience working as an attaché on China between 1928 and 1932, reaching the rank of Captain upon his return. The lack of capable staff forced an early promotion to Brigadier General for Wyman, but he has shown willingness to learn despite being thrown in such a difficult position."
NEE_LEMUEL_SHEPHERD_ARMY_DESC:0 "§YGeneral Description\n§YBorn:§W February 10, 1896, in Norfolk, Virginia, United States of America\n§YMilitary Career:§W Lemuel Cornick 'Lem' Shepherd Jr. graduated from the Virginia Military Institute in 1917, and would enter the Marine Corps right after as a second lieutenant. He'd slowly climbed his way to Captain in 1922, where he was assigned to the Marine Company that assisted the Brazil's Centennial Exposition and would be later reassigned to the Marine Detachment in the USS New York. In 1927, he was shipped to Tianjin to serve in the 3rd Marine Brigade guarding the American Legation in the city. Lemuel would return to America in 1929 and graduate from the Field Officers' Course in 1932. He'd be sent to Haiti to serve with the Garde d'Haïti as a District and Department Commander, where he earned his promotion to Major. In 1934, Shepherd was detailed to the Marine Barracks, Washington, D. C., as Executive Officer and as Registrar of the Marine Corps Institute and would be promoted to Lieutenant Colonel in early 1936. After his promotion, he was assigned to the Naval War College at Newport, Rhode Island. With the country spiralling into Civil War and the Canadian seizure of New England, Shepherd presented his services to the New England Government, earning his promotion to Brigadier General and being assigned" to the New England Marine Corps, where his experience shall be greatly valued by the small New England staff."
