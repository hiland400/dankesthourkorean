kr.political.24.d:0 "The Kaiserreich Team proudly present Kaiserreich alpha version 0.9.3 for Hearts of Iron 4! Our team has been working hard from every corner of the world to bring this new version to you. We hope you will enjoy playing it as much as we did making it.\n\nYou should be aware that the mod is designed with the assumption that the player will always annex all possible states in peace treaties, so make sure to do that!\n\nAll the normal options found in the starting events have been moved to the wonderful game options added in 1.6. You can now select the frequency of news events and what naming system states and VP's use, among other things. Don't forget to adjust them each game as they sadly aren't saved.\n\nFinally, we'd like to remind you this mod is still in Alpha, so expect bugs, crashes and various headaches. If you encounter any of these, please report them on our GitHub bug tracker.\n\nEnjoy!"
